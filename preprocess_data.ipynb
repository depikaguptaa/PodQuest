i. jordan , a professor at berkeley and one of the most influential people in the history of machine learning , statistic , and artificial intelligence . he ha been cited over 170,000 time and he ha mentored many of the world class researcher defining the field of ai today , including andrew ng , zubin garamani , ben taskar , and yoshua bengio . all this , to me , is a impressive a the over 32,000 point in the six nba championship of the michael j. jordan of basketball fame . there 's a nonzero probability that i talked to the other michael jordan given my connection to and love of the chicago bull of the 90 , but if i had to pick one , i 'm going with the michael jordan of statistic and computer science , or a yann lecun call him , the mile davis of machine learning . in his blog post titled artificial intelligence , the revolution ha n't happened yet , michael argues for broadening the scope of the artificial intelligence field . in many way , the underlying spirit of this podcast is the same , to see artificial intelligence a a deeply human endeavor , to not only engineer algorithm and robot , but to understand and empower human being at all level of abstraction , from the individual to our civilization a a whole . this is the artificial intelligence podcast . if you enjoy it , subscribe and youtube , give it five star at apple podcast , support it on patreon , or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman spelled f r i d m a n. a usual , i 'll do one or two minute of ad now and never any ad in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation . i hope that work for you and doe n't hurt the listening experience . this show is presented by cash app , the number one finance app in the app store . when you get it , use code lex podcast . cash app let you send money to friend , buy bitcoin , and invest in the stock market with a little a $ 1 . since cash app doe fractional share trading , let me mention that the order execution algorithm that worked behind the scene to create the abstraction of the fractional order is to me an algorithmic marvel . great prop for the cash app engineer for solving a hard problem that in the end provides an easy interface that take a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market , making trading more accessible for new investor and diversification much easier . so once again , if you get cash app from the app store or google play and use the code lex podcast , you 'll get $ 10 and cash app will also donate $ 10 to first , one of my favorite organization that is helping to advance robotics and stem education for young people around the world . and now , here 's my conversation with michael i. jordan . given that you 're one of the great in the field of ai , machine learning , computer science , and so on , you 're trivially called the michael jordan of machine learning , although a you know , you were born first , so technically mj is the michael i. jordan of basketball . but anyway , my favorite is yann lecun calling you the mile davis of machine learning because a he say , you reinvent yourself periodically and sometimes leave fan scratching their head after you change direction . so can you put at first your historian hat on and give a history of computer science and ai a you saw it , a you experienced it , including the four generation of ai success that i 've seen you talk about ? sure . yeah , first of all , i much prefer yann 's metaphor . mile davis wa a real explorer in jazz and he had a coherent story . so i think i have one , but it 's not just the one you lived , it 's the one you think about later . what the historian doe is they look back and they revisit . i think what 's happening right now is not ai , that wa an intellectual aspiration that 's still alive today a an aspiration . but i think this is akin to the development of chemical engineering from chemistry or electrical engineering from electromagnetism . so if you go back to the 30 or 40 , there wa n't yet chemical engineering . there wa chemistry , there wa fluid flow , there wa mechanic and so on . but people pretty clearly viewed interesting goal to try to build factory that make chemical product and do it viably , safely , make good one , do it at scale . so people started to try to do that , of course , and some factory worked , some did n't , some were not viable , some exploded , but in parallel , developed a whole field called chemical engineering . electrical engineering is a field , it 's no bone about it , it ha theoretical aspect to it , it ha practical aspect . it 's not just engineering , quote unquote , it 's the real thing , real concept are needed . same thing with electrical engineering . there wa maxwell 's equation , which in some sense were everything you know about electromagnetism , but you needed to figure out how to build circuit , how to build module , how to put them together , how to bring electricity from one point to another safely and so on and so forth . so a whole field that developed called electrical engineering . i think that 's what 's happening right now , is that we have a proto field , which is statistic , more of the theoretical side of it , algorithmic side of computer science , that wa enough to start to build thing , but what thing ? system that bring value to human being and use human data and mix in human decision . the engineering side of that is all ad hoc . that 's what 's emerging . in fact , if you wan na call machine learning a field , i think that 's what it is , that it 's a proto form of engineering based on statistical and computational idea of previous generation . but do you think there 's something deeper about ai in his dream and aspiration a compared to chemical engineering and electrical engineering ? well the dream and aspiration maybe , but those are 500 year from now . i think that that 's like the greek sitting there and saying , it would be neat to get to the moon someday . i think we have no clue how the brain doe computation . we 're just a clueless . we 're even worse than the greek on most anything interesting scientifically of our era . can you linger on that just for a moment because you stand not completely unique , but a little bit unique in the clarity of that . can you elaborate your intuition of why we 're , like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain ? and a lot of people say , you know , scientist say we 're not very far in understanding human brain , but you 're like , you 're saying we 're in the dark here . well , i know i 'm not unique . i do n't even think in the clarity , but if you talk to real neuroscientist that really study real synapsis or real neuron , they agree , they agree . it 's a hundred of year task and they 're building it up slowly and surely . what the signal is there is not clear . we think we have all of our metaphor . we think it 's electrical , maybe it 's chemical , it 's a whole soup , it 's ion and protein and it 's a cell . and that 's even around like a single synapse . if you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse , it 's a city of it own . and that 's one little thing on a dendritic tree , which is extremely complicated electrochemical thing . and it 's doing these spike and voltage are flying around and then protein are taking that and taking it down into the dna and who know what . so it is the problem of the next few century . it is fantastic . but we have our metaphor about it . is it an economic device ? is it like the immune system or is it like a layered set of , you know , arithmetic computation ? we have all these metaphor and they 're fun . but that 's not real science per se . there is neuroscience . that 's not neuroscience . all right . that 's like the greek speculating about how to get to the moon , fun , right ? and i think that i like to say this fairly strongly because i think a lot of young people think we 're on the verge because a lot of people who do n't talk about it clearly let it be understood that , yes , we kind of , this is a brain inspired , we 're kind of close , you know , breakthrough are on the horizon . and that 's scrupulous people sometimes who need money for their lab . that 's what i 'm saying , scrupulous , but people will oversell , i need money for my lab , i 'm studying computational neuroscience , i 'm going to oversell it . and so there 's been too much of that . so i 'll step into the gray area between metaphor and engineering with , i 'm not sure if you 're familiar with brain computer interface . so a company like elon musk ha neuralink that 's working on putting electrode into the brain and trying to be able to read , both read and send electrical signal . just a you said , even the basic mechanism of communication in the brain is not something we understand . but do you hope without understanding the fundamental principle of how the brain work , we 'll be able to do something interesting at that gray area of metaphor ? it 's not my area . so i hope in the sense , like anybody else hope for some interesting thing to happen from research , i would expect more something like alzheimer 's will get figured out from modern neuroscience . there 's a lot of human suffering based on brain disease and we throw thing like lithium at the brain , it kind of work , no one ha a clue why . that 's not quite true , but mostly we do n't know . and that 's even just about the biochemistry of the brain and how it lead to mood swing and so on . how thought emerges from that , we were really , really completely dim . so that you might want to hook up electrode and try to do some signal processing on that and try to find pattern , fine , by all mean , go for it . it 's just not scientific at this point . so it 's like kind of sitting in a satellite and watching the emission from a city and trying to infer thing about the microeconomy , even though you do n't have microeconomic concept . it 's really that kind of thing . and so yes , can you find some signal that do something interesting or useful ? can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain ? yeah , absolutely , and then i can imagine business model based on that and even medical application of that . but from there to understanding algorithm that allow u to really tie in deeply from the brain to computer , i just , no , i do n't agree with elon musk . i do n't think that 's even , that 's not for our generation , not even for the century . so just in hope of getting you to dream , you 've mentioned kolmogorov and turing might pop up , do you think that there might be breakthrough that will get you to sit back in five , 10 year and say , wow ? oh , i 'm sure there will be , but i do n't think that there 'll be demo that impress me . i do n't think that having a computer call a restaurant and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough . right . and people , you know , some people present it a such . it 's imitating human intelligence . it 's even putting cough in the thing to make a bit of a pr stunt . and so fine that the world run on those thing too . and i do n't want to diminish all the hard work and engineering that go behind thing like that and the ultimate value to the human race . but that 's not scientific understanding . and i know the people that work on these thing , they are after scientific understanding . in the meantime , they 've got to kind of , you know , the train got to run and they got mouth to feed and they got thing to do and there 's nothing wrong with all that . i would call that though , just engineering . and i want to distinguish that between an engineering field , like electrical engineering and chemical engineering that originally emerged , that had real principle and you really know what you 're doing and you had a little scientific understanding , maybe not even complete . so it became more predictable and it really gave value to human life because it wa understood . and so we do n't want to muddle too much these water of , you know , what we 're able to do versus what we really ca n't do in a way that 's going to impress the next . so i do n't need to be wowed , but i think that someone come along in 20 year , a younger person who 's absorbed all the technology and for them to be wowed , i think they have to be more deeply impressed . a young kolmogorov would not be wowed by some of the stunt that you see right now coming from the big company . the demo , but do you think the breakthrough from kolmogorov would be , and give this question a chance , do you think there 'll be in the scientific fundamental principle arena or do you think it 's possible to have fundamental breakthrough in engineering ? meaning , you know , i would say some of the thing that elon musk is working with spacex and then others sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamental of engineering , of manufacturing , of saying , here 's a problem we know how to do a demo of and actually taking it to scale . yeah . so there 's going to be all kind of breakthrough . i just do n't like that terminology . i 'm a scientist and i work on thing day in and day out and thing move along and eventually you say , wow , something happened , but i do n't like that language very much . also i do n't like to prize theoretical breakthrough over practical one . i tend to be more of a theoretician and i think there 's lot to do in that arena right now . and so i would n't point to the kolmogorovs , i might point to the edison of the era and maybe musk is a bit more like that . but you know , musk , god bless him , also will say thing about ai that he know very little about and he lead people astray when he talk about thing he doe n't know anything about . trying to program a computer to understand natural language , to be involved in a dialogue we 're having right now , that ai n't going to happen in our lifetime . you could fake it , you can mimic , sort of take old sentence that human use and retread them , but the deep understanding of language , no , it 's not going to happen . and so from that , i hope you can perceive that the deeper , yet deeper kind of aspect and intelligence are not going to happen . now will there be breakthrough ? no , i think that google wa a breakthrough , i think amazon is a breakthrough , you know , i think uber is a breakthrough , you know , that bring value to human being at scale in new , brand new way based on data flow and so on . a lot of these thing are slightly broken because there 's not kind of an engineering field that take economic value in context of data and , you know , planetary scale and worry about all the externality , the privacy , you know , we do n't have that field so we do n't think these thing through very well . i see that a emerging and that will be , you know , looking back from 100 year , that will be a constituted breakthrough in this era , just like electrical engineering wa a breakthrough in the early part of the last century and chemical engineering wa a breakthrough . so the scale , the market that you talk about and we 'll get to will be seen a sort of breakthrough and we 're in the very early day of really doing interesting stuff there and we 'll get to that , but just taking a quick step back , can you give , kind of throw off the historian hat . i mean , you briefly said that the history of ai kind of mimic the history of chemical engineering , but ... i keep saying machine learning . you keep wanting to say ai , just to let you know , i do n't , you know , i resist that . i do n't think this is about ai really wa john mccarthy a almost a philosopher saying , would n't it be cool if we could put thought in a computer ? if we could mimic the human capability to think or put intelligence in , in some sense into a computer . that 's an interesting philosophical question and he wanted to make it more than philosophy . he wanted to actually write down a logical formula and algorithm that would do that . and that is a perfectly valid , reasonable thing to do . that 's not what 's happening in this era . so the reason i keep saying ai actually , and i 'd love to hear what you think about it . machine learning ha a very particular set of method and tool . maybe your version of it is that mine doe n't , it 's very , very open . it doe optimization , it doe sampling , it doe ... so system that learn is what machine learning is . system that learn and make decision . and make decision . so it 's not just pattern recognition and , you know , finding pattern , it 's all about making decision in real world and having close feedback loop . so something like symbolic ai , expert system , reasoning system , knowledge based representation , all of those kind of thing , search , doe that neighbor fit into what you think of a machine learning ? so i do n't even like the word machine learning , i think that what the field you 're talking about is all about making large collection of decision under uncertainty by large collection of entity . right ? and there are principle for that , at that scale . you do n't have to say the principle are for a single entity that 's making decision , single agent or single human . it really immediately go to the network of decision . is a good word for that or no ? no , there 's no good word for any of this . that 's kind of part of the problem . so we can continue the conversation to use ai for all that . i just want to kind of raise the flag here that this is not about , we do n't know what intelligence is and real intelligence . we do n't know much about abstraction and reasoning at the level of human . we do n't have a clue . we 're not trying to build that because we do n't have a clue . eventually it may emerge . they 'll make , i do n't know if there 'll be breakthrough , but eventually we 'll start to get glimmer of that . it 's not what 's happening right now . okay . we 're taking data . we 're trying to make good decision based on that . we 're trying to scale . we 're trying to economically viably , we 're trying to build market . we 're trying to keep value at that scale and aspect of this will look intelligent . computer were so dumb before , they will seem more intelligent . we will use that buzzword of intelligence so we can use it in that sense . so machine learning , you can scope it narrowly a just learning from data and pattern recognition . but when i talk about these topic , maybe data science is another word you could throw in the mix , it really is important that the decision are a part of it . it 's consequential decision in the real world . am i going to have a medical operation ? am i going to drive down the street ? thing where there 's scarcity , thing that impact other human being or other environment and so on . how do i do that based on data ? how do i do that adaptively ? how do i use computer to help those kind of thing go forward ? whatever you want to call that . so let 's call it ai . let 's agree to call it ai , but let 's not say that the goal of that is intelligence . the goal of that is really good working system at planetary scale that we 've never seen before . so reclaim the word ai from the dartmouth conference from many decade ago of the dream of human . i do n't want to reclaim it . i want a new word . i think it wa a bad choice . i mean , if you read one of my little thing , the history wa basically that mccarthy needed a new name because cybernetics already existed and he did n't like , no one really liked norbert wiener . norbert wiener wa kind of an island to himself and he felt that he had encompassed all this and in some sense he did . you look at the language of cybernetics , it wa everything we 're talking about . it wa control theory and signal processing and some notion of intelligence and closed feedback loop and data . it wa all there . it 's just not a word that lived on partly because of the maybe the personality . but mccarthy needed a new word to say , i 'm different from you . i 'm not part of your show . i got my own . invented this word and again , thinking forward about the movie that would be made about it , it wa a great choice . but thinking forward about creating a sober academic and real world discipline , it wa a terrible choice because it led to promise that are not true that we understand . we understand artificial perhaps , but we do n't understand intelligence . it 's a small tangent because you 're one of the great personality of machine learning , whatever the heck you call the field . do you think science progress by personality or by the fundamental principle and theory and research that 's outside of personality ? both . and i would n't say there should be one kind of personality . i have mine and i have my preference and i have a kind of network around me that feed me and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree , but all kind of personality are needed . right now , i think the personality that it 's a little too exuberant , a little bit too ready to promise the moon is a little bit too much in ascendance . and i do think that there 's some good to that . it certainly attracts lot of young people to our field , but a lot of those people come in with strong misconception and they have to then unlearn those and then find something to do . and so i think there 's just got to be some multiple voice and i wa n't hearing enough of the more sober voice . so a a continuation of a fun tangent and speaking of vibrant personality , what would yeah . and you think technically speaking , it 's possible to help . i do n't know the answer , but it 's a , it 's a , it 's a le anonymity , a little more locality , you know , world that you kind of enter in and you trust the people there in those world so that when you start having a discussion , you know , not only is that people are not going to hurt you , but it 's not going to be a total waste of your time because there 's a lot of wasting of time that , you know , a lot of u , i pulled out of facebook early on cause it wa clearly going to waste a lot of my time even though there wa some value . and so , yeah , world that are somehow you enter in and you know what you 're getting and it 's kind of appeal to you and you might , new thing might happen , but you kind of have some , some trust in that world . and there 's some deep , interesting , complex psychological aspect around anonymity , how that change human behavior that 's quite dark . quite dark . yeah . i think a lot of u are , especially those of u who really loved the advent of technology . i love social network when they came out . i wa just , i did n't see any negative there at all . but then i started seeing comment section . i think it wa maybe , you know , with the cnn or something . and i started to go , wow , this , this darkness i just did not know about and , and our technology is now amplifying it . so sorry for the big philosophical question , but on that topic , do you think human being , cause you 've also , out of all thing , had a foot in psychology too , the , do you think human being are fundamentally good ? like all of u have good intent that could be mind or is it depending on context and environment , everybody could be evil . so my answer is fundamentally good . but fundamentally limited . all of u have very , you know , blinker on . we do n't see the other person 's pain that easily . we do n't see the other person 's point of view that easily . we 're very much in our own head , in our own world . and on my good day , i think the technology could open u up to , you know , more perspective and more le blinkered and more understanding , you know , a lot of war in human history happened because of just ignorance . they did n't , they , they thought the other person wa doing this while their person wa n't doing this . and we have a huge amount of that . but in my lifetime , i 've not seen technology really help in that way yet . and i do , i do , i do believe in that , but you know , no , i think fundamentally human are good . the people suffer , people have grievance because you have grudge and those thing cause them to do thing they probably would n't want . they regret it often . so no , i , i think it 's a , you know , part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it to be a little easier to be the real good person you actually are . well , but do you think individual human life or society could be modeled a an optimization problem ? not the way i think typically , i mean , that 's , you 're talking about one of the most complex phenomenon in the whole , you know , in all of which the individual human life or society a a whole . both , both . i mean , individual human life is amazingly complex . and so you know , optimization is kind of just one branch of mathematics that talk about certain kind of thing . and it just feel way too limited for the complexity of such thing . what property of optimization problem do you think , so do you think most interesting problem that could be solved through optimization , what kind of property doe that surface have non convexity , convexity , linearity , all those kind of thing , saddle point ? well , so optimization is just one piece of mathematics . you know , there 's like , you just , even in our era , we 're aware that say sampling is coming up , example of something coming up with a distribution . what 's optimization ? what 's sampling ? well , they , you can , if you 're a kind of a certain kind of mathematician , you can try to blend them and make them seem to be sort of the same thing . but optimization is roughly speaking , trying to find a point that , a single point that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind . and sampling is trying to , from that same surface , treat that a a distribution or density and find point that have high density . so i want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm and i want the , you know , the single point , that 's the best point in the optimization paradigm . now if you were optimizing in the space of probability measure , the output of that could be a whole probability distribution . so you can start to make these thing the same . but in mathematics , if you go too high up that kind of abstraction hierarchy , you start to lose the , you know , the ability to do the interesting theorem . so you kind of do n't try that . you do n't try to overly over abstract . so a a small tangent , what kind of worldview do you find more appealing ? one that is deterministic or stochastic ? well , that 's easy . i mean , i 'm a statistician . you know , the world is highly stochastic . i do n't know what 's going to happen in the next five minute , right ? because what you 're going to ask , what we 're going to do , what i 'll say . due to the uncertainty . due to the ... massive uncertainty . yeah . you know , massive uncertainty . and so the best i can do is have come rough sense or probability distribution on thing and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now . so how doe the distributed at scale when you have multi agent system look like ? so optimization can optimize sort of , it make a lot more sense , sort of at least from my from robotics perspective , for a single robot , for a single agent , trying to optimize some objective function . when you start to enter the real world , this game theoretic concept start popping up . that 's how do you see optimization in this ? because you 've talked about market in a scale . what doe that look like ? do you see it a optimization ? do you see it a sampling ? do you see like , how should you mark ? these all blend together . and a system designer thinking about how to build an incentivized system will have a blend of all these thing . so , you know , a particle in a potential well is optimizing a functional called a lagrangian , right ? the particle doe n't know that . there 's no algorithm running that doe that . it just happens . and so it 's a description mathematically of something that help u understand a analyst what 's happening , right ? and so the same thing will happen when we talk about , you know , mixture of human and computer and market and so on and so forth , there 'll be certain principle that allow u to understand what 's happening , whether or not the actual algorithm are being used by any sense is not clear . now at some point , i may have set up a multi agent or market kind of system . and i 'm now thinking about an individual agent in that system . and they 're asked to do some task and they 're incentivized in some way , they get certain signal and they have some utility . what they will do at that point is they just wo n't know the answer , they may have to optimize to find an answer . okay , so an artist could be embedded inside of an overall market . you know , and game theory is very , very broad . it is often studied very narrowly for certain kind of problem . but it 's roughly speaking , this is just the , i do n't know what you 're going to do . so i kind of anticipate that a little bit , and you anticipate what i 'm anticipating . and we kind of go back and forth in our own mind . we run kind of thought experiment . you 've talked about this interesting point in term of game theory , you know , most optimization problem really hate saddle point , maybe you can describe what saddle point are . but i 've heard you kind of mentioned that there 's a there 's a branch of optimization that you could try to explicitly look for saddle point a a good thing . oh , not optimization . that 's just game theory that that so there 's all kind of different equilibrium in game theory . and some of them are highly explanatory behavior . they 're not attempting to be algorithmic . they 're just trying to say , if you happen to be at this equilibrium , you would see certain kind of behavior . and we see that in real life . that 's what an economist want to do , especially behavioral economist in continuous differential game theory , you 're in continuous space , a some of the simplest equilibrium are saddle point and nash equilibrium a a saddle point . it 's a special kind of saddle point . so classically , in game theory , you were trying to find nash equilibrium and an algorithmic game theory , you 're trying to find algorithm that would find them . and so you 're trying to find saddle point . i mean , so that 's literally what you 're trying to do . but you know , any economist know that nash equilibrium have their limitation . they are definitely not that explanatory in many situation . they 're not what you really want . there 's other kind of equilibrium . and there 's name associated with these because they came from history with certain people working on them , but there will be new one emerging . so you know , one example is a stackelberg equilibrium . so you know , nash , you and i are both playing this game against each other or for each other , maybe it 's cooperative , and we 're both going to think it through and then we 're going to decide and we 're going to do our thing simultaneously . you know , in a stackelberg , no , i 'm going to be the first mover . i 'm going to make a move . you 're going to look at my move and then you 're going to make yours . now since i know you 're going to look at my move , i anticipate what you 're going to do . and so i do n't do something stupid , but then i know that you are also anticipating me . so we 're kind of going back and forth on why , but there is then a first mover thing . and so those are different equilibrium , right ? and so just mathematically , yeah , these thing have certain topology and certain shape that are like , what 's it , algorithmically or dynamically , how do you move towards them ? how do you move away from thing ? you know , so some of these question have answer , they 've been studied , others do not . and especially if it becomes stochastic , especially if there 's large number of decentralized thing , there 's just , you know , young people get in this field who kind of think it 's all done because we have , you know , tensorflow . well , no , these are all open problem and they 're really important and interesting . and it 's about strategic setting . how do i collect data ? suppose i do n't know what you 're going to do because i do n't know you very well , right ? well , i got to collect data about you . so maybe i want to push you into a part of the space where i do n't know much about you so i can get data . cause , and then later i 'll realize that you 'll never , you 'll never go there because of the way the game is set up . you know , that 's part of the overall , you know , data analysis context is that . even the game of poker is fascinating space , whenever there 's any uncertainty , a lack of information , it 's a super exciting space . just to linger on optimization for a second . so when we look at deep learning , it 's essentially minimization of a complicated loss function . so is there something insightful or hopeful that you see in the kind of function surface that loss function , the deep learning and in the real world is trying to optimize over ? is there something interesting a it 's just the usual kind of problem of optimization ? i think from an optimization point of view , that surface , first of all , it 's pretty smooth . and secondly , if there 's over , if it 's over parameterized , there 's kind of lot of path down to reasonable optimum . and so kind of the getting downhill to the , to an optimum is viewed a not a hard a you might 've expected in high dimension . the fact that some optimum tend to be really good one and others not so good . and you tend to , it 's not , sometimes you find the good one is sort of still need explanation . yeah . but , but the particular surface is coming from the particular generation of neural net . i kind of suspect those will , those will change in 10 year . it will not be exactly those surface . there 'll be some others that are an optimization theory will help contribute to why other surface or why other algorithm . year of arithmetic operation with a little bit of nonlinearity , that 's not , that did n't come from neuroscience per se . i mean , maybe in the mind of some of the people working on it , they were thinking about brain , but they were arithmetic circuit in all kind of field , computer science control theory and so on . and that layer of these could transform thing in certain way . and that if it 's smooth , maybe you could find parameter value is a sort of big discovery that it 's working , it 's able to work at this scale . but i do n't think that we 're stuck with that and we 're , we 're certainly not stuck with that cause we 're understanding the brain . so in term of on the algorithm side sort of gradient descent , do you think we 're stuck with gradient descent a a variance of it ? what variance do you find interesting or do you think there 'll be something else invented that is able to walk all over these optimization space in more interesting way ? so there 's a co design of the surface and the , or the architecture and the algorithm . so if you just ask if we stay with the kind of architecture that we have now and not just neural net , but you know , phase retrieval architecture or matrix completion architecture and so on . you know , i think we 've kind of come to a place where yeah , a stochastic gradient algorithm are dominant and there are version that are a little better than others . they have more guarantee , they 're more robust and so on . and there 's ongoing research to kind of figure out which is the best arm for which situation . but i think that that 'll start to co evolve , that that 'll put pressure on the actual architecture . and so we should n't do it in this particular way , we should do it in a different way because this other algorithm is now available if you do it in a different way . so that i ca n't really anticipate that co evolution process , but you know , gradient are amazing mathematical object . they have a lot of people who start to study them more deeply mathematically are kind of shocked about what they are and what they can do . think about it this way , suppose that i tell you if you move along the x axis , you go uphill in some objective by three unit , whereas if you move along the y axis , you go uphill by seven unit , right ? now i 'm going to only allow you to move a certain unit distance , right ? what are you going to do ? well , most people will say that i 'm going to go along the y axis , i 'm getting the biggest bang for my buck , you know , and my buck is only one unit , so i 'm going to put all of it in the y axis , right ? and why should i even take any of my strength , my step size and put any of it in the x axis because i 'm getting le bang for my buck . that seems like a completely clear argument and it 's wrong because the gradient direction is not to go along the y axis , it 's to take a little bit of the x axis . and to understand that , you have to know some math and so even a trivial so called operator like gradient is not trivial and so , you know , exploiting it property is still very important . now we know that just pervading descent ha got all kind of problem , it get stuck in many way and it had never , you know , good dimension dependence and so on . so my own line of work recently ha been about what kind of stochasticity , how can we get dimension dependence , how can we do the theory of that and we 've come up pretty favorable result with certain kind of stochasticity . we have sufficient condition generally . we know if you do this , we will give you a good guarantee . we do n't have necessary condition that it must be done a certain way in general . so stochasticity , how much randomness to inject into the walking along the gradient ? and what kind of randomness ? why is randomness good in this process ? why is stochasticity good ? yeah , so i can give you simple answer but in some sense again , it 's kind of amazing . stochasticity just , you know , particular feature of a surface that could have hurt you if you were doing one thing deterministically wo n't hurt you because by chance , there 's very little chance that you would get hurt . so here stochasticity , it just kind of save you from some of the particular feature of surface . in fact , if you think about surface that are discontinuous in our first derivative , like an absolute value function , you will go down and hit that point where there 's nondifferentiability . and if you 're running a deterministic algorithm at that point , you can really do something bad . whereas stochasticity just mean it 's pretty unlikely that 's going to happen , that you 're going to hit that point . so it 's again , nontrivial to analyze but especially in higher dimension , also stochasticity , our intuition is n't very good about it but it ha property that kind of are very appealing in high dimension for a lot of large number of reason . so it 's all part of the mathematics to kind of , that 's what 's fun to work in the field is that you get to try to understand this mathematics . but long story short , you know , partly empirically , it wa discovered stochastic gradient is very effective and theory kind of followed , i 'd say , that but i do n't see that we 're getting clearly out of that . what 's the most beautiful , mysterious , a profound idea to you in optimization ? i do n't know the most . but let me just say that nesterov 's work on nesterov acceleration to me is pretty surprising and pretty deep . can you elaborate ? well nesterov acceleration is just that , suppose that we are going to use gradient to move around in a space . for the reason i 've alluded to , they 're nice direction to move . and suppose that i tell you that you 're only allowed to use gradient , you 're not going to be allowed to use this local person that can only sense kind of the change in the surface . but i 'm going to give you kind of a computer that 's able to store all your previous gradient . and so you start to learn some something about the surface . and i 'm going to restrict you to maybe move in the direction of like a linear span of all the gradient . so you ca n't kind of just move in some arbitrary direction , right ? so now we have a well defined mathematical complexity model . there 's certain class of algorithm that can do that and others that ca n't . and we can ask for certain kind of surface , how fast can you get down to the optimum ? so there 's answer to these . so for a smooth convex function , there 's an answer , which is one over the number of step squared . you will be within a ball of that size after k step . gradient descent in particular ha a slower rate , it 's one over k. so you could ask , is gradient descent actually , even though we know it 's a good algorithm , is it the best algorithm ? and the answer is no . well , not clear yet , because one over k squared is a lower bound . that 's probably the best you can do . gradient is one over k , but is there something better ? and so i think a a surprise to most , nesterov discovered a new algorithm that ha got two piece to it . it 's two gradient and put those together in a certain kind of obscure way . and the thing doe n't even move downhill all the time . it sometimes go back uphill . and if you 're a physicist , that kind of make some sense . you 're building up some momentum and that is kind of the right intuition , but that intuition is not enough to understand kind of how to do it and why it work . but it doe . it achieves one over k squared and it ha a mathematical structure and it 's still kind of to this day , a lot of u are writing paper and trying to explore that and understand it . so there are lot of cool idea and optimization , but just kind of using gradient , i think is number one that go back , you know , 150 year . and then nesterov , i think ha made a major contribution with this idea . so like you said , gradient themselves are in some sense , mysterious . they 're not a trivial a ... not a trivial . coordinate descent is more of a trivial one . you just pick one of the coordinate . that 's how we think . that 's how our human mind think . that 's how our human mind think . and gradient are not that easy for our human mind to grapple with . an absurd question , but what is statistic ? so here it 's a little bit , it 's somewhere between math and science and technology . it 's somewhere in that convex hole . so it 's a set of principle that allow you to make inference that have got some reason to be believed and also principle that allow you to make decision where you can have some reason to believe you 're not going to make error . so all of that requires some assumption about what do you mean by an error ? what do you mean by the probability ? but after you start making some of those assumption , you 're led to conclusion that , yes , i can guarantee that if you do this in this way , your probability of making an error will be small . your probability of continuing to not make error over time will be small . and the probability that you found something that 's real will be small , will be high . so decision making is a big part of that . decision making is a big part . yeah . so statistic , short history wa that , it go back a a formal discipline , 250 year or so . it wa called inverse probability because around that era , probability wa developed sort of especially to explain gambling situation . of course , interesting . so you would say , well , given the state of nature is this , there 's a certain roulette board that ha a certain mechanism and what kind of outcome do i expect to see ? and especially if i do thing long amount of time , what outcome will i see ? and the physicist started to pay attention to this . and then people said , well , let 's turn the problem around . what if i saw certain outcome , could i infer what the underlying mechanism wa ? that 's an inverse problem . and in fact , for quite a while , statistic wa called inverse probability . that wa the name of the field . and i believe that it wa laplace who wa working in napoleon 's government who needed to do a census of france , learn about the people there . so he went and gathered data and he analyzed that data to determine policy and said , well , let 's call this field that doe this kind of thing statistic because the word state is in there . in french , that 's etat , but it 's the study of data for the state . so anyway , that caught on and it 's been called statistic ever since . but by the time it got formalized , it wa sort of in the 30 . and around that time , there wa game theory and decision theory developed nearby . people in that era did n't think of themselves a either computer science or statistic or control or econ . they were all the above . and so von neumann is developing game theory , but also thinking of that a decision theory . wald is an econometrician developing decision theory and then turning that into statistic . and so it 's all about , here 's not just data and you analyze it , here 's a loss function . here 's what you care about . here 's the question you 're trying to ask . here is a probability model and here 's the risk you will face if you make certain decision . and to this day , in most advanced statistical curriculum , you teach decision theory a the starting point and then it branch out into the two branch of bayesian and frequentist . but that 's all about decision . in statistic , what is the most beautiful , mysterious , maybe surprising idea that you 've come across ? yeah , good question . i mean , there 's a bunch of surprising one . there 's something that 's way too technical for this thing , but something called james stein estimation , which is kind of surprising and really take time to wrap your head around . can you try to maybe ... i think i do n't want to even want to try . let me just say a colleague at steven stigler at university of chicago wrote a really beautiful paper on james stein estimation , which help to ... it 's view a paradox . it kind of defeat the mind 's attempt to understand it , but you can and steve ha a nice perspective on that . so one of the trouble with statistic is that it 's like in physic that are in quantum physic , you have multiple interpretation . there 's a wave and particle duality in physic and you get used to that over time , but it still kind of haunt you that you do n't really quite understand the relationship . the electron 's a wave and electron 's a particle . well the same thing happens here . there 's bayesian way of thinking and frequentist , and they are different . they sometimes become sort of the same in practice , but they are physically different . and then in some practice , they are not the same at all . they give you rather different answer . and so it is very much like wave and particle duality , and that is something that you have to kind of get used to in the field . can you define bayesian and frequentist ? yeah in decision theory you can make , i have a video that people could see . it 's called are you a bayesian or a frequentist and kind of help try to make it really clear . it come from decision theory . so you know , decision theory , you 're talking about loss function , which are a function of data x and parameter theta . they 're a function of two argument . okay . neither one of those argument is known . you do n't know the data a priori . it 's random and the parameter unknown . all right . so you have a function of two thing you do n't know , and you 're trying to say , i want that function to be small . i want small loss , right ? well what are you going to do ? so you sort of say , well , i 'm going to average over these quantity or maximize over them or something so that , you know , i turn that uncertainty into something certain . so you could look at the first argument and average over it , or you could look at the second argument and average over it . that 's bayesian and frequentist . so the frequentist say , i 'm going to look at the x , the data , and i 'm going to take that a random and i 'm going to average over the distribution . so i take the expectation loss under x. theta is held fixed , right ? that 's called the risk . and so it 's looking at other , all the data set you could get , right ? and say , how well will a certain procedure do under all those data set ? that 's called a frequentist guarantee , right ? so i think it is very appropriate when like you 're building a piece of software and you 're shipping it out there and people are using it on all kind of data set . you want to have a stamp , a guarantee on it that a people run it on many , many data set that you never even thought about that 95 % of the time it will do the right thing . perfectly reasonable . the bayesian perspective say , well , no , i 'm going to look at the other argument of the loss function , the theta part , okay ? that 's unknown and i 'm uncertain about it . so i could have my own personal probability for what it is , you know , how many tall people are there out there ? i 'm trying to infer the average height of the population while i have an idea roughly what the height is . so i 'm going to average over the theta . so now that loss function a only now , again , one argument 's gone , now it 's a function of x and that 's what a bayesian doe is they say , well , let 's just focus on the particular x we got , the data set we got , we condition on that . conditional on the x , i say something about my loss . that 's a bayesian approach to thing . and the bayesian will argue that it 's not relevant to look at all the other data set you could have gotten and average over them , the frequentist approach . it 's really only the data set you got , right ? and i do agree with that , especially in situation where you 're working with a scientist , you can learn a lot about the domain and you 're really only focused on certain kind of data and you gathered your data and you make inference . i do n't agree with it though , that , you know , in the sense that there are need for frequentist guarantee , you 're writing software , people are using it out there , you want to say something . so these two thing have to got to fight each other a little bit , but they have to blend . so long story short , there 's a set of idea that are right in the middle that are called empirical bayes . and empirical bayes sort of start with the bayesian framework . it 's kind of arguably philosophically more , you know , reasonable and kosher . write down a bunch of the math that kind of flow from that , and then realize there 's a bunch of thing you do n't know because it 's the real world and you do n't know everything . so you 're uncertain about certain quantity . at that point , ask , is there a reasonable way to plug in an estimate for those thing ? okay . and in some case , there 's quite a reasonable thing to do , to plug in , there 's a natural thing you can observe in the world that you can plug in and then do a little bit more mathematics and assure yourself it 's really good . so based on math or based on human expertise , what 's , what , what are good ? oh , they 're both going in . the bayesian framework allows you to put a lot of human expertise in , but the math kind of guide you along that path and then kind of reassures you the end , you could put that stamp of approval under certain assumption , this thing will work . so you asked the question , what 's my favorite , you know , or what 's the most surprising , nice idea . so one that is more accessible is something called false discovery rate , which is , you know , you 're making not just one hypothesis test or making one decision , you 're making a whole bag of them . and in that bag of decision , you look at the one where you made a discovery , you announced that something interesting had happened . all right . that 's going to be some subset of your big bag . in the one you made a discovery , which subset of those are bad ? or false , false discovery . you 'd like the fraction of your false discovery among your discovery to be small . that 's a different criterion than accuracy or precision or recall or sensitivity and specificity . it 's a different quantity . those latter one are almost all of them have more of a frequentist flavor . they say , given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true . here 's what accuracy i would get , or given that the alternative is true , here 's what i would get . so it 's kind of going forward from the state of nature to the data . the bayesian go the other direction from the data back to the state of nature . and that 's actually what false discovery rate is . it say , given you made a discovery , okay , that 's conditioned on your data . what 's the probability of the hypothesis ? it 's going the other direction . and so the classical frequency look at that , well , i ca n't know that there 's some prior needed in that . and the empirical bayesian go ahead and plow forward and start writing down these formula and realizes at some point , some of those thing can actually be estimated in a reasonable way . and so it 's kind of , it 's a beautiful set of idea . so i , this kind of line of argument ha come out . it 's not certainly mine , but it sort of came out from robbins around 1960 . brad efron ha written beautifully about this in various paper and book . and the fdr is , you know , benjamin in israel , john story did this bayesian interpretation and so on . and he used to absorb these thing over the year and find it a very healthy way to think about statistic . let me ask you about intelligence to jump slightly back out into philosophy , perhaps . you said that maybe you can elaborate , but you said that defining just even the question of what is intelligence is a very difficult question . is it a useful question ? do you think we 'll one day understand the fundamental of human intelligence and what it mean , you know , have good benchmark for general intelligence that we put before our machine ? so i do n't work on these topic so much that you 're really asking the question for a psychologist really . and i studied some , but i do n't consider myself at least an expert at this point . you know , a psychologist aim to understand human intelligence , right ? and i think many psychologist i know are fairly humble about this . they might try to understand how a baby understands , you know , whether something 's a solid or liquid or whether something 's hidden or not . and maybe how a child start to learn the meaning of certain word , what 's a verb , what 's a noun and also , you know , slowly but surely trying to figure out thing . but human ability to take a really complicated environment , reason about it , abstract about it , find the right abstraction , communicate about it , interact and so on is just , you know , really staggeringly rich and complicated . and so , you know , i think in all humility , we do n't think we 're kind of aiming for that in the near future . a certain psychologist doing experiment with baby in the lab or with people talking ha a much more limited aspiration . and you know , kahneman and tversky would look at our reasoning pattern and they 're not deeply understanding all the how we do our reasoning , but they 're sort of saying , hey , here 's some oddity about the reasoning and some thing you should think about it . but also , a i emphasize in some thing i 've been writing about , you know , ai , the revolution ha n't happened yet . yeah . great blog post . i 've been emphasizing that , you know , if you step back and look at intelligent system of any kind and whatever you mean by intelligence , it 's not just the human or the animal or , you know , the plant or whatever , you know , so a market that brings good into a city , you know , food to restaurant or something every day is a system . it 's a decentralized set of decision . looking at it from far enough away , it 's just like a collection of neuron . every neuron is making it own little decision , presumably in some way . and if you step back enough , every little part of an economic system is making all of it decision . and just like with the brain , who know what an individual neuron doe and what the overall goal is , right ? but something happens at some aggregate level , same thing with the economy . people eat in a city and it 's robust . it work at all scale , small village to big city . it 's been working for thousand of year . it work rain or shine , so it 's adaptive . so all the kind of , you know , those are adjective one tends to apply to intelligent system . robust , adaptive , you know , you do n't need to keep adjusting it , self healing , whatever . plus not perfect . you know , intelligence are never perfect and market are not perfect . but i do not believe in this era that you can not , that you can say , well , our computer are , our human are smart , but you know , no market are not , more market are . so they are intelligent . now we human did n't evolve to be market . we 've been participating in them , right ? but we are not ourselves a market per se . the neuron could be viewed a the market . there 's economic , you know , neuroscience kind of perspective . that 's interesting to pursue all that . the point though is , is that if you were to study human and really be the world 's best psychologist studied for thousand of year and come up with the theory of human intelligence , you might have never discovered principle of market , you know , supply demand curve and you know , matching and auction and all that . those are real principle and they lead to a form of intelligence that 's not maybe human intelligence . it 's arguably another kind of intelligence . there probably are third kind of intelligence or fourth that none of u are really thinking too much about right now . so if you really , and then all of those are relevant to computer system in the future . certainly the market one is relevant right now . whereas the understanding of human intelligence is not so clear that it 's relevant right now . probably not . so if you want general intelligence , whatever one mean by that , or , you know , understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that , it is definitely ha to be not just human intelligence . it 's got ta be this broader thing . and that 's not a mystery . market are intelligent . so , you know , it 's definitely not just a philosophical stance to say we 've got to move beyond intelligence . that sound ridiculous . yeah . but it 's not . and in that blog post , you define different kind of like intelligent infrastructure , ai , which i really like is some of the concept you 've just been describing . do you see ourselves , if we see earth , human civilization a a single organism , do you think the intelligence of that organism , when you think from the perspective of market and intelligence infrastructure is increasing , is it increasing linearly ? is it increasing exponentially ? what do you think the future of that intelligence ? yeah , i do n't know . i do n't tend to think , i do n't tend to answer question like that because you know , that 's science fiction . i 'm hoping to catch you off guard . well again , because you said it 's so far in the future , it 's fun to ask and you 'll probably , you know , like you said , predicting the future is really nearly impossible . but say a an axiom , one day we create a human level , a superhuman level intelligent , not the scale of market , but the scale of an individual . what do you think it is , what do you think it would take to do that ? or maybe to ask another question is how would that system be different than the biological human being that we see around u today ? is it possible to say anything interesting to that question or is it just a stupid question ? it 's not a stupid question , but it 's science fiction . science fiction . and so i 'm totally happy to read science fiction and think about it from time in my own life . i loved , there wa this like brain in a vat kind of , you know , little thing that people were talking about when i wa a student , i remember , you know , imagine that , you know , between your brain and your body , there 's a , you know , there 's a bunch of wire , right ? and suppose that every one of them wa replaced with a literal wire . and then suppose that wire wa turned in actually a little wireless , you know , there 's a receiver and sender . so the brain ha got all the sender and receiver , you know , on all of it exiting , you know , axon and all the dendrite down to the body have replaced with sender and receiver . now you could move the body off somewhere and put the brain in a vat , right ? and then you could do thing like start killing off those sender and receiver one by one . and after you 've killed off all of them , where is that person ? you know , they thought they were out in the body walking around the world and they moved on . so those are science fiction thing . those are fun to think about . it 's just intriguing about where is , what is thought , where is it and all that . and i think every 18 year old should take philosophy class and think about these thing . and i think that everyone should think about what could happen in society that 's kind of bad and all that . but i really do n't think that 's the right thing for most of u that are my age group to be doing and thinking about . i really think that we have so many more present , you know , first challenge and danger and real thing to build and all that such that , you know , spending too much time on science fiction , at least in public for like this , i think is not what we should be doing . maybe over beer in private . that 's right . well , i 'm not going to broadcast where i have beer because this is going to go on facebook and i do n't want a lot of people showing up there . but yeah , i 'll , i love facebook , twitter , amazon , youtube . i have i 'm optimistic and hopeful , but maybe , maybe i do n't have ground for such optimism and hope . but let me ask , you 've mentored some of the brightest sort of some of the seminal figure in the field . can you give advice to people who are undergraduate today ? what doe it take to take , you know , advice on their journey if they 're interested in machine learning and in the idea of market from economics and psychology and all the kind of thing that you 've exploring ? what step should they take on that journey ? well , yeah , first of all , the door is open and second , it 's a journey . i like your language there . it is not that you 're so brilliant and you have great , brilliant idea and therefore that 's just , you know , that 's how you have success or that 's how you enter into the field . it 's that you apprentice yourself , you spend a lot of time , you work on hard thing , you try and pull back and you be a broad a you can , you talk to lot of people . and it 's like entering in any kind of a creative community . there 's year that are needed and human connection are critical to it . so , you know , i think about , you know , being a musician or being an artist or something , you do n't just , you know , immediately from day one , you know , you 're a genius and therefore you do it . no , you , you know , practice really , really hard on basic and you be humble about where you are and then , and you realize you 'll never be an expert on everything . so you kind of pick and there 's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck , but luck just kind of pick out which branch of the tree you go down , but you 'll go down some branch . so yeah , it 's a community . so the graduate school is , i still think is one of the wonderful phenomenon that we have in our , in our world . it 's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor . it 's very much about a group of people you belong to . it 's a four or five year process . so it 's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing to come up to something , you know , more , more expertise , and then to start to have your own creativity start to flower , even surprising your own self . and it 's a very cooperative endeavor . i think a lot of people think of science a highly competitive and i think in some other field it might be more so . here it 's way more cooperative than you might imagine . and people are always teaching each other something and people are always more than happy to be clear that , so i feel i 'm an expert on certain kind of thing , but i 'm very much not expert on lot of other thing and a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are , i should know , but should in some society , you know , you do n't . so i 'm always willing to reveal my ignorance to people around me so they can teach me thing . and i think a lot of u feel that way about our field . so it 's very cooperative . i might add it 's also very international because it 's so cooperative . we see no barrier . and so that the nationalism that you see , especially in the current era and everything is just at odds with the way that most of u think about what we 're doing here , where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate and are very much trying to do it together for the , you know , the benefit of everybody . so last question , where and how and why did you learn french and which language is more beautiful english or french ? great question . so first of all , i think italian is actually more beautiful than french and english . and i also speak that . so i 'm married to an italian and i have kid and we speak italian . anyway , all kidding aside , every language allows you to express thing a bit differently . and it is one of the great fun thing to do in life is to explore those thing . so in fact , when i kid or teen or college student ask me what they study , i say , well , do what your heart , where your heart is , certainly do a lot of math . math is good for everybody , but do some poetry and do some history and do some language too . you know , throughout your life , you 'll want to be a thinking person . you 'll want to have done that . for me , french i learned when i wa , i 'd say a late teen , i wa living in the middle of the country in kansa and not much wa going on in kansa with all due respect to kansa . and so my parent happened to have some french book on the shelf and just in my boredom , i pulled them down and i found this is fun . and i kind of learned the language by reading . and when i first heard it spoken , i had no idea what wa being spoken , but i realized i had somehow knew it from some previous life and so i made the connection . but then i traveled and just i love to go beyond my own barrier and my own comfort or whatever . and i found myself on train in france next to say older people who had lived a whole life of their own . and the ability to communicate with them wa special and the ability to also see myself in other people 's shoe and have empathy and kind of work on that language a part of that . so after that kind of experience and also embedding myself in french culture , which is quite amazing , language are rich , not just because there 's something inherently beautiful about it , but it 's all the creativity that went into it . so i learned a lot of song , read poem , read book . and then i wa here actually at mit where we 're doing the podcast today and a young professor not yet married and not having a lot of friend in the area . so i just did n't have , i wa kind of a bored person . i said , i heard a lot of italian around . there 's happened to be a lot of italian at mit , an italian professor for some reason . and so i wa kind of vaguely understanding what they were talking about . i said , well , i should learn this language too . so i did . and then later met my spouse and italian became a part of my life . but i go to china a lot these day . i go to asia , i go to europe and every time i go , i kind of am amazed by the richness of human experience and the people do n't have any idea if you have n't traveled , kind of how amazingly rich and i love the diversity . it 's not just a buzzword to me . it really mean something . i love to embed myself with other people 's experience . and so yeah , learning language is a big part of that . i think i 've said in some interview at some point that if i had million of dollar and infinite time or whatever , what would you really work on if you really wanted to do ai ? and for me , that is natural language and really done right . deep understanding of language . that 's to me , an amazingly interesting scientific challenge . one we 're very far away on . one we 're very far away , but good natural language . people are kind of really invested then . i think a lot of them see that 's where the core of ai is that if you understand that you really help human communication , you understand something about the human mind , the semantics that come out of the human mind and i agree , i think that will be such a long time . so i did n't do that in my career just cause i kind of , i wa behind in the early day . i did n't kind of know enough of that stuff . i wa at mit , i did n't learn much language and it wa too late at some point to kind of spend a whole career doing that , but i admire that field and so in my little way by learning language , you know , kind of that part of my brain ha been trained up . jan wa right . you truly are the mile davis of machine learning . i do n't think there 's a better place than it .

you with some word of wisdom from michael i. jordan from his blog post titled artificial intelligence , the revolution ha n't happened yet , calling for broadening the scope of the ai field . we should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing is the creation of a new branch of engineering . the term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense in academia and beyond with overtone of cold , effectless machinery and negative connotation of loss of control by human . but an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be . in the current era , we have a real opportunity to conceive of something historically new , a human centric engineering discipline . i will resist giving this emerging discipline a name , but if the acronym ai continues to be used , let 's be aware of the very real limitation of this placeholder . let 's broaden our scope , tone down the hype , and recognize the serious challenge ahead . thank you for listening and hope to see you next time . you say is the most interesting disagreement you have with jan lacune ? so jan 's an old friend and i just say that i do n't think we disagree about very much really . he and i both kind of have a let 's build it kind of mentality and doe it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete . we both speak french and we speak french more together and we have a lot in common . and so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement , it 's not really a fundamental one . i think it 's just kind of what we 're emphasizing . jan ha emphasized pattern recognition and ha emphasized prediction . and it 's interesting to try to take that a far a you can . if you could do perfect prediction , what would that give you kind of a a thought experiment ? and i think that 's way too limited . we can not do perfect prediction . we will never have the data set that allow me to figure out what you 're about ready to do , what question you 're going to ask next . i have no clue . i will never know such thing . moreover , most of u find ourselves during the day in all kind of situation we had no anticipation of that are kind of very , very novel in various way . and in that moment , we want to think through what we want . and also there 's going to be market force acting on u . i 'd like to go down that street , but now it 's full because there 's a crane in the street . i got it . i got to think about that . i got to think about what i might really want here . and i got to sort of think about how much it cost me to do this action versus this action . i got to think about the risk involved . a lot of our current pattern recognition and prediction system do n't do any risk evaluation . they have no error bar , right ? i got to think about other people 's decision around me . i got to think about a collection of my decision , even just thinking about like a medical treatment , you know , i 'm not going to take a , the prediction of a neural net about my health , about something consequential . i 'm not about ready to have a heart attack because some number is over 0.7 . even if you had all the data in the world that ever been collected about heart attack better than any doctor ever had , i 'm not going to trust the output of that neural net to predict my heart attack . i 'm going to want to ask what if question around that . i 'm going to want to look at some u or other possible data i did n't have , causal thing . i 'm going to want to have a dialogue with a doctor about thing we did n't think about when he gathered the data . you know , i could go on and on . i hope you can see . and i do n't , i think that if you say prediction , everything that , that , that you 're missing all of this stuff . and so prediction plus decision making is everything , but both of them are equally important . and so the field ha emphasized prediction , jan rightly so ha seen how powerful that is . but at the cost of people not being aware that decision making is where the rubber really hit the road , where human life are at stake , where risk are being taken , where you got to gather more data . you got to think about the error bar . you got to think about the consequence of your decision on others . you got to think about the economy around your decision , blah , blah , blah , blah . i 'm not the only one working on those , but we 're a smaller tribe . and right now we 're not the one that people talk about the most . but you know , if you go out in the real world and industry , you know , at amazon , i 'd say half the people there are working on decision making and the other half are doing , you know , the pattern recognition . it 's important . and the word of pattern recognition and prediction , i think the distinction there , not to linger on word , but the distinction there is more a constrained sort of in the lab data set versus decision making is talking about consequential decision in the real world , under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world . and just the whole of it , the whole mess of it that actually touch human being and scale . and the force , that 's the distinction . it help add those , that perspective , that broader perspective . you 're right . i totally agree . on the other hand , if you 're a real prediction person , of course , you want it to be in the real world . you want to predict real world event . i 'm just saying that 's not possible with just data set . that it ha to be in the context of , you know , strategic thing that someone 's doing , data they might gather , thing they could have gathered , the reasoning process around data . it 's not just taking data and making prediction based on the data . so one of the thing that you 're working on , i 'm sure there 's others working on it , but i do n't hear often it talked about , especially in the clarity that you talk about it , and i think it 's both the most exciting and the most concerning area of ai in term of decision making . so you 've talked about ai system that help make decision that scale in a distributed way , million , billion decision , sort of market of decision . can you , a a starting point , sort of give an example of a system that you think about when you 're thinking about these kind of system ? yeah , so first of all , you 're absolutely getting into some territory , which i will be beyond my expertise . and there are lot of thing that are going to be very not obvious to think about . just like , again , i like to think about history a little bit , but think about put yourself back in the sixty . there wa kind of a banking system that wa n't computerized really . there wa database theory emerging and database people had to think about how do i actually not just move data around , but actual money and have it be , you know , valid and have transaction that atm happen that are actually , you know , all valid and so on and so forth . so that 's the kind of issue you get into when you start to get serious about sort of thing like this . i like to think about a kind of almost a thought experiment to help me think something simpler , which is the music market . and because there is , to first order , there is no music market in the world right now and in our country , for sure . there are something called thing called record company and they make money and they prop up a few really good musician and make them superstar and they all make huge amount of money . but there 's a long tail of huge number of people that make lot and lot of really good music that is actually listened to by more people than the famous people . they are not in a market . they can not have a career . they do not make money . the creator , the creator , the creator , the so called influencers or whatever that diminishes who they are . so there are people who make extremely good music , especially in the hip hop or latin world these day . they do it on their laptop . that 's what they do on the weekend and they have another job during the week and they put it up on soundcloud or other site . eventually it get streamed . it now get turned into bit . it 's not economically valuable . the information is lost . it get put up there . people stream it . you walk around in a big city , you see people with headphone , especially young kid listening to music all the time . if you look at the data , very little of the music they are listening to is the famous people 's music and none of it 's old music . it 's all the latest stuff . but the people who made that latest stuff are like some 16 year old somewhere who will never make a career out of this , who will never make money . of course there will be a few counter example . the record company incentivize to pick out a few and highlight them . long story short , there 's a missing market there . there is not a consumer producer relationship at the level of the actual creative act . the pipeline and spotify 's of the world that take this stuff and stream it along , they make money off of subscription or advertising and those thing . they 're making the money . all right . and then they will offer bit and piece of it to a few people again to highlight that they simulate a market . anyway , a real market would be if you 're a creator of music that you actually are somebody who 's good enough that people want to listen to you , you should have the data available to you . there should be a dashboard showing a map of the united state . so in last week , here 's all the place your song were listened to . it should be transparent , vetable , so that if someone down in providence see that you 're being listened to 10,000 time in providence , that they know that 's real data . you know it 's real data . they will have you come give a show down there . they will broadcast to the people who 've been listening to you that you 're coming . if you do this right , you could go down there and make $ 20,000 . you do that three time a year , you start to have a career . so in this sense , ai creates job . it 's not about taking away human job . it 's creating new job because it creates a new market . once you 've created a market , you 've now connected up producer and consumer . the person who 's making the music can say to someone who come to their show a lot , hey , i 'll play at your daughter 's wedding for $ 10,000 . you 'll say 8,000 . they 'll say 9,000 . then again , you can now get an income up to $ 100,000 . you 're not going to be a millionaire . and now even think about really the value of music is in these personal connection , even so much so that a young kid want to wear a tshirt with their favorite musician 's signature on it . so if they listen to the music on the internet , the internet should be able to provide them with a button that they push and the merchandise arrives the next day . we can do that . and now why should we do that ? well , because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy , but more the person who made the music will get the money . there 's no advertising needed . so you can create market between producer and consumer , take 5 % cut . your company will be perfectly sound . it 'll go forward into the future and it will create new market and that raise human happiness . now this seems like , well , this is easy , just create this dashboard , kind of create some connection and all that . but if you think about uber or whatever , you think about the challenge in the real world of doing thing like this , and there are actually new principle going to be needed . you 're trying to create a new kind of two way market at a different scale that 's ever been done before . there 's going to be unwanted aspect of the market . there 'll be bad people . there 'll be the data will get used in the wrong way , it 'll fail in some way , it wo n't deliver about . you have to think that through . just like anyone who ran a big auction or ran a big matching service in economics will think these thing through . and so that maybe doe n't get at all the huge issue that can arise when you start to create market , but it start to , at least for me , solidify my thought and allow me to move forward in my own thinking . yeah . so i talked to the head of research at spotify actually , and i think their longterm goal , they 've said , is to have at least one million creator make a comfortable living putting on spotify . so i think you articulate a really nice vision of the world and the digital and the cyberspace of market . what do you think company like spotify or youtube or netflix can do to create such market ? is it an ai problem ? is it an interface problem for interface design ? is it some other kind of , is it an economics problem ? who should they hire to solve these problem ? well , part of it 's not just top down . so the silicon valley ha this attitude that they know how to do it . they will create the system just like google did with the search box that will be so good that they 'll just , everyone will adopt that . it 's everything you said , but really i think missing that kind of culture . so it 's literally that 16 year old who 's able to create the song . you do n't create that a a silicon valley entity . you do n't hire them per se . you have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted and that they belong . and so you have to have some cultural credibility to do thing like this . netflix , to their credit , wanted some of that credibility and they created show , content . they call it content . it 's such a terrible word , but it 's culture . and so with movie , you can kind of go give a large sum of money to somebody graduating from the usc film school . it 's a whole thing of it own , but it 's kind of like rich white people 's thing to do . and american culture ha not been so much about rich white people . it 's been about all the immigrant , all the african who came and brought that culture and those rhythm to this world and created this whole new thing . american culture . and so company ca n't artificially create that . they ca n't just say , hey , we 're here . we 're going to buy it up . you 've got a partner . and so anyway , not to denigrate , these company are all trying and they should , and i 'm sure they 're asking these question and some of them are even making an effort . but it is partly a respect the culture a a technology person . you 've got to blend your technology with cultural meaning . how much of a role do you think the algorithm , so machine learning ha in connecting the consumer to the creator , sort of the recommender system aspect of this ? yeah . it 's a great question . i think pretty high . there 's no magic in the algorithm , but a good recommender system is way better than a bad recommender system . and recommender system is a billion dollar industry back even 10 , 20 year ago . and it continues to be extremely important going forward . what 's your favorite recommender system , just so we can put something , well , just historically i wa one of the , when i first went to amazon , i first did n't like amazon because they put the book people out of business or the library , the local bookseller went out of business . i 've come to accept that there probably are more book being sold now and poor people reading them than ever before . and then local book store are coming back . so that 's how economics sometimes work . you go up and you go down . but anyway , when i finally started going there and i bought a few book , i wa really pleased to see another few book being recommended to me that i never would have thought of . and i bought a bunch of them . so they obviously had a good business model . but i learned thing and i still to this day kind of browse using that service . and i think lot of people get a lot , that is a good aspect of a recommendation system . i 'm learning from my peer in an indirect way . and their algorithm are not meant to have them impose what we learn . it really is trying to find out what 's in the data . it doe n't work so well for other kind of entity , but that 's just the complexity of human life . like shirt , i 'm not going to get recommendation on shirt , but that 's interesting . if you try to recommend restaurant , it 's hard . it 's hard to do it at scale . but a blend of recommendation system with other economic idea , matchings and so on is really , really still very open research wise . and there 's new company that are going to emerge that do that well . what do you think is going to the messy , difficult land of say politics and thing like that , that youtube and twitter have to deal with in term of recommendation system ? being able to suggest , i think facebook just launched facebook news . so recommend the kind of news that are most likely for you to be interesting . do you think this is ai solvable , again , whatever term we want to use , do you think it 's a solvable problem for machine or is it a deeply human problem that 's unsolvable ? so i do n't even think about it at that level . i think that what 's broken with some of these company , it 's all monetization by advertising . they 're not , at least facebook , i want to critique them , but they did n't really try to connect a producer and a consumer in an economic way , right ? no one want to pay for anything . and so they all , you know , starting with google and facebook , they went back to the playbook of , you know , the television company back in the day . no one wanted to pay for this signal . they will pay for the tv box , but not for the signal , at least back in the day . and so advertising kind of filled that gap and advertising wa new and interesting and it somehow did n't take over our life quite , right ? fast forward , google provides a service that people do n't want to pay for . and so somewhat surprisingly in the ninety , they made , they ended up making huge amount so they cornered the advertising market . it did n't seem like that wa going to happen , at least to me . these little thing on the right hand side of the screen just did not seem all that economically interesting , but that company had maybe no other choice . the tv market wa going away and billboard and so on . so they 've , they got it . and i think that sadly that google just ha , it wa doing so well with that at making such money . they did n't think much more about how , wait a minute , is there a producer consumer relationship to be set up here ? not just between u and the advertiser market to be created . is there an actual market between the producer consumer ? they 're the producer , the person who created that video clip , the person that made that website , the person who could make more such thing , the person who could adjust it a a function of demand , the person on the other side who 's asking for different kind of thing , you know ? so you see glimmer of that now there 's influencers and there 's kind of a little glimmering of a market , but it should have been done 20 year ago . it should have been thought about . it should have been created in parallel with the advertising ecosystem . and then facebook inherited that . and i think they also did n't think very much about that . so fast forward and now they are making huge amount of money off of advertising . and the news thing and all these click is just feeding the advertising . it 's all connected up to the advertiser . so you want more people to click on certain thing because that money flow to you , facebook . you 're very much incentivized to do that . and when you start to find it 's breaking , people are telling you , well , we 're getting into some trouble . you try to adjust it with your smart ai algorithm , right ? and figure out what are bad click . so maybe it should n't be click through rate , it should be something else . i find that pretty much hopeless . it doe get into all the complexity of human life and you can try to fix it . you should , but you could also fix the whole business model . and the business model is that really , what are , are there some human producer and consumer out there ? is there some economic value to be liberated by connecting them directly ? is it such that it 's so valuable that people will be able to pay for it ? all right . and micro payment , like small payment . micro , but even have to be micro . so i like the example , suppose i 'm going , next week i 'm going to india . never been to india before . right ? i have a couple of day in mumbai , i have no idea what to do there . right ? and i could go on the web right now and search . it 's going to be kind of hopeless . i 'm not going to find , you know , i have lot of advertiser in my face . right ? what i really want to do is broadcast to the world that i am going to mumbai and have someone on the other side of a market look at me and , and there 's a recommendation system there . so i 'm not looking at all possible people coming to mumbai . they 're looking at the people who are relevant to them . so someone in my age group , someone who kind of know me in some level , i give up a little privacy by that , but i 'm happy because what i 'm going to get back is this person can make a little video for me , or they 're going to write a little two page paper on here 's the cool thing that you want to do and move by this week , especially , right ? i 'm going to look at that . i 'm not going to pay a micro payment . i 'm going to pay , you know , a hundred dollar or whatever for that . it 's real value . it 's like journalism . um , and a an honest subscription , it 's that i 'm going to pay that person in that moment . company 's going to take 5 % of that . and that person ha now got it . it 's a gig economy , if you will , but you know , done for it , you know , thinking about a little bit behind youtube , there wa actually people who could make more of those thing . if they were connected to a market , they would make more of those thing independently . you do n't have to tell them what to do . you do n't have to incentivize them any other way . um , and so , yeah , these company , i do n't think have thought long and hard about that . so i do distinguish on facebook on the one side , who just not thought about these thing at all . i think , uh , thinking that ai will fix everything , uh , and amazon think about them all the time because they were already out in the real world . they were delivering package , people 's door . they were , they were worried about a market . they were worried about seller and , you know , they worry and some thing they do are great . some thing maybe not so great , but you know , they 're in that business model . and then i 'd say google sort of hovers somewhere in between . i do n't , i do n't think for a long , long time they got it . i think they probably see that youtube is more pregnant with possibility than , than , than they might 've thought and that they 're probably heading that direction . um , but uh , you know , silicon valley ha been dominated by the google facebook kind of mentality and the subscription and advertising and that is , that 's the core problem , right ? the fake news actually ride on top of that because it mean that you 're monetizing with clip through rate and that is the core problem . you got to remove that . so advertisement , if we 're going to linger on that , i mean , that 's an interesting thesis . i do n't know if everyone really deeply think about that . so you 're right . the thought is the advertising model is the only thing we have , the only thing we 'll ever have . we have to fix , we have to build algorithm that despite that business model , you know , find the better angel of our nature and do good by society and by the individual . but you think we can slowly , you think , first of all , there 's a difference between should and could . so you 're saying we should slowly move away from the advertising model and have a direct connection between the consumer and the creator . the question i also have is , can we , because the advertising model is so successful now in term of just making a huge amount of money and therefore being able to build a big company that provides , ha really smart people working that create a good service . do you think it 's possible ? and just to clarify , you think we should move away ? well , i think we should . yeah . but we is the , you know , me . so society . yeah . well , the company , i mean , so first of all , full disclosure , i 'm doing a day a week at amazon because i kind of want to learn more about how they do thing . so , you know , i 'm not speaking for amazon in any way , but , you know , i did go there because i actually believe they get a little bit of this or trying to create these market . and they do n't really use , advertising is not a crucial part of it . well , that 's a good question . so it ha become not crucial , but it 's become more and more present if you go to amazon website . and , you know , without revealing too many deep secret about amazon , i can tell you that , you know , a lot of people in the company question this and there 's a huge questioning going on . you do not want a world where there 's zero advertising . that actually is a bad world . okay . so here 's a way to think about it . you 're a company that like amazon is trying to bring product to customer , right ? and the customer , at any given moment , you want to buy a vacuum cleaner , say , you want to know what 's available for me . and , you know , it 's not going to be that obvious . you have to do a little bit of work at it . the recommendation system will sort of help , right ? but now suppose this other person over here ha just made the world , you know , they spent a huge amount of energy . they had a great idea . they made a great vacuum cleaner . they know they really did it . they nailed it . it 's an mit , you know , whiz kid that made a great new vacuum cleaner , right ? it 's not going to be in the recommendation system . no one will know about it . the algorithm will not find it and ai will not fix that . okay . at all . right . how do you allow that vacuum cleaner to start to get in front of people , be sold well advertising . and here , what advertising is , it 's a signal that you 're , you believe in your product enough that you 're willing to pay some real money for it . and to me a a consumer , i look at that signal . i say , well , first of all , i know these are not just cheap little ad cause we have now right now there . i know that , you know , these are super cheap , you know , penny . if i see an ad where it 's actually , i know the company is only doing a few of these and they 're making , you know , real money is kind of flowing and i see an ad , i may pay more attention to it . and i actually might want that because i see , hey , that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner . maybe there 's something good there . so i will look at it . and so that 's part of the overall information flow in a good market . so advertising ha a role , but the problem is of course that that signal is now completely gone because it just , you know , dominant by these tiny little thing that add up to big money for the company , you know ? so i think it will just , i think it will change because the society just do n't , you know , stick with thing that annoy a lot of people and advertising currently annoys people more than it provides information . and i think that a google probably is smart enough to figure out that this is a dead , this is a bad model , even though it 's a hard , huge amount of money and they 'll have to figure out how to pull it away from it slowly . and i 'm sure the ceo there will figure it out , but they need to do it . and they needed it to , so if you reduce advertising , not to zero , but you reduce it at the same time you bring up producer , consumer , actual real value being delivered . so real money is being paid and they take a 5 % cut that 5 % could start to get big enough to cancel out the lost revenue from the kind of the poor kind of advertising . and i think that a good company will do that , will realize that . and facebook , you know , again , god bless them . they bring , you know , grandmother , they bring child 's picture into grandmother life . it 's fantastic . but they need to think of a new business model and that 's the core problem there . until they start to connect producer consumer , i think they will just continue to make money and then buy the next social network company and then buy the next one and the innovation level will not be high and the health issue will not go away . so i apologize that we kind of returned to word , i do n't think the exact term matter , but in sort of defense of advertisement , do n't you think the kind of direct connection between consumer and creator producer is what advertisement strives to do , right ? so that is best advertisement is literally now facebook is listening to our conversation and heard that you 're going to india and will be able to actually start automatically for you making these connection and start giving this offer . so like , i apologize if it 's just a matter of term , but just to draw a distinction , is it possible to make advertisement just better and better and better algorithmically to where it actually becomes a connection , almost a direct connection ? that 's a good question . so let 's component on that . first of all , what we just talked about , i wa defending advertising . okay . so i wa defending it a a way to get signal into a market that do n't come any other way , especially algorithmically . it 's a sign that someone spent money on it , it 's a sign they think it 's valuable . and if i think that if other thing , someone else think it 's valuable , and if i trust other people , i might be willing to listen . i do n't trust that facebook though , who 's an intermediary between this . i do n't think they care about me . okay . i do n't think they do . and i find it creepy that they know i 'm going to india next week because of our conversation . why do you think that is ? so what , could you just put your pr hat on ? why do you think you find facebook creepy and not trust them a do majority of the population ? so they 're out of the silicon valley company , i saw like not approval rate , but there 's ranking of how much people trust company and facebook is in the gutter . in the gutter , including people inside of facebook . so what do you attribute that to ? because when i ... come on , you do n't find it creepy that right now we 're talking that i might walk out on the street right now that some unknown person who i do n't know kind of come up to me and say , i hear you 're going to india . i mean , that 's not even facebook . that 's just , i want transparency in human society . i want to have , if you know something about me , there 's actually some reason you know something about me . that 's something that if i look at it later and audit it kind of , i approve . you know something about me because you care in some way . there 's a caring relationship even , or an economic one or something . not just that you 're someone who could exploit it in way i do n't know about or care about or i 'm troubled by or whatever . we 're in a world right now where that happens way too much and that facebook know thing about a lot of people and could exploit it and doe exploit it at time . i think most people do find that creepy . it 's not for them . it 's not that facebook is not doing it because they care about them in a real sense . and they should n't . they should not be a big brother caring about u . that is not the role of a company like that . why not ? wait , not the big brother part , but the caring , the trusting . i mean , do n't those company , just to link on it because a lot of company have a lot of information about u . i would argue that there 's company like microsoft that ha more information about u than facebook doe and yet we trust microsoft more . well , microsoft is pivoting . microsoft , you know , under satya nadella ha decided this is really important . we do n't want to do creepy thing . really want people to trust u to actually only use information in way that they really would approve of , that we do n't decide , right ? and i 'm just kind of adding that the health of a market is that when i connect to someone who produce a consumer , it 's not just a random producer or consumer , it 's people who see each other . they do n't like each other , but they sense that if they transact , some happiness will go up on both side . if a company help me to do that in moment that i choose of my choosing , then fine . so , and also think about the difference between , you know , browsing versus buying , right ? there are moment in my life i just want to buy , you know , a gadget or something . i need something for that moment . i need some ammonia for my house or something because i got a problem with a spill . i want to just go in . i do n't want to be advertised at that moment . i do n't want to be led down various , you know , that 's annoying . i want to just go and have it be extremely easy to do what i want . other moment i might say , no , it 's like today i 'm going to the shopping mall . i want to walk around and see thing and see people and be exposed to stuff . so i want control over that though . i do n't want the company 's algorithm to decide for me , right ? i think that 's the thing . there 's a total loss of control if facebook think they should take the control from u of deciding when we want to have certain kind of information , when we do n't , what information that is , how much it relates to what they know about u that we did n't really want them to know about u . i do n't want them to be helping me in that way . i do n't want them to be helping them by they decide they have control over what i want and when . i totally agree . facebook , by the way , i have this optimistic thing where i think facebook ha the kind of personal information about u that could create a beautiful thing . so i 'm really optimistic of what facebook could do . it 's not what it 's doing , but what it could do . so i do n't see that . i think that optimism is misplaced because there 's not a bit , you have to have a business model behind these thing . create a beautiful thing is really , let 's be , let 's be clear . it 's about something that people would value . and i do n't think they have that business model and i do n't think they will suddenly discover it by what , you know , a long hot shower . i disagree . i disagree in term of , you can discover a lot of amazing thing in a shower . so i did n't say that . i said , they wo n't come , they wo n't do it , but in the shower , i think a lot of other people will discover it . i think that this guy , so i should also , full disclosure , there 's a company called united master , which i 'm on their board and they 've created this music market and i have a hundred thousand artist now signed on and they 've done thing like gone to the nba and the nba , the music you find behind nba clip right now is their music , right ? that 's a company that had the right business model in mind from the get go , right ? executed on that . and from day one , there wa value brought to , so here you have a kid who made some song who suddenly their song are on the nba website , right ? that 's real economic value to people . and so , you know , so you and i differ on the optimism of being able to sort of change the direction of the titanic , right ? so i , yeah , i 'm older than you , so i 've seen some titanic 's crash , got it . but and just to elaborate , cause i totally agree with you and i just want to know how difficult you think this problem is of , so for example , i want to read some news and i would , there 's a lot of time in the day where something make me either smile or think in a way where i like consciously think this really gave me value . like i sometimes listen to the daily podcasts in the new york time , way better than the new york time themselves , by the way , for people listening . that 's like real journalism is happening for some reason in the podcast space . it doe n't make sense to me , but often i listen to it 20 minute and i would be willing to pay for that , like $ 5 , $ 10 for that experience . and how difficult , that 's kind of what you 're getting at is that little transaction . how difficult is it to create a frictionless system like uber ha , for example , for other thing ? what 's your intuition there ? so i , first of all , i pay little bit of money to , you know , to send , there 's something called court that doe financial thing . i like medium a a site , i do n't pay there , but i would . you had a great post on medium . i would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others . i would n't have wanted it per se because there should be also site where that 's not actually the goal . the goal is to actually have a broadcast channel that i monetize in some other way if i chose to . i mean , i could now people know about it . i could , i 'm not doing it , but that 's fine with me . also the musician who are making all this music , i do n't think the right model is that you pay a little subscription fee to them , right ? because people can copy the bit too easily and it 's just not that somewhere the value is . the value is that a connection wa made between real human being , then you can follow up on that . all right . and create yet more value . so no , i think there 's a lot of open question here , hot open question , but also , yeah , i do want good recommendation system that recommend cool stuff to me . but it 's pretty hard , right ? i do n't like them to recommend stuff just based on my browsing history . i do n't like the based on stuff they know about me , quote unquote . what 's unknown about me is the most interesting . so this is the , this is the really interesting question . we may disagree , maybe not . i think that i love recommender system and i want to give them everything about me in a way that i trust . yeah . but you , but you do n't , because , so for example , this morning i clicked on a , you know , i wa pretty sleepy this morning . i clicked on a story about the queen of england . yes . right . i do not give a damn about the queen of england . i really do not . but it wa clickbait . it kind of looked funny and i had to say , what the heck are they talking about ? i do n't want to have my life , you know , heading that direction . now that 's in my browsing history . the system in any reasonable system will think that i care about the queen of england . that 's browsing history . right . but , but you 're saying all the trace , all the digital exhaust or whatever , that 's been kind of the model . if you collect all this stuff , you 're going to figure all of u out . well , if you 're trying to figure out like kind of one person like trump or something , maybe you could figure him out . but if you 're trying to figure out , you know , 500 million people , you know , no way , no way . you think so ? no , i do . i think so . i think we are , human are just amazingly rich and complicated . every one of u ha our little quirk , every one of u ha our little thing that could intrigue u that we do n't even know it will intrigue u . and there 's no sign of it in our past , but by god , there it come and you know , you fall in love with it . and i do n't want a company trying to figure that out for me and anticipate that i want them to provide a forum , a market , a place that i kind of go and by hook or by crook , this happens , you know , i i 'm walking down the street and i hear some chilean music being played and i never knew i liked chilean music , but wow . so there is that side and i want them to provide a limited , but you know , interesting place to go . right . and so do n't try to use your ai to kind of , you know , figure me out and then put me in a world where you figured me out , you know , no , create huge space for human being where our creativity and our style will be enriched and come forward and it 'll be a lot of more transparency . i wo n't have people randomly , anonymously putting comment up and i 'll special based on stuff they know about me , fact that , you know , we are so broken right now . if you 're , you know , especially if you 're a celebrity , but you know , it 's about anybody that anonymous people are hurting lot and lot of people right now . that 's part of this thing that silicon valley is thinking that , you know , just collect all this information and use it in a great way . so no , i 'm not , i 'm not a pessimist , i 'm very much an optimist by nature , but i think that 's just been the wrong path for the whole technology to take . be more limited , create , let human rise up . do n't try to replace them . that 's the ai mantra . do n't try to anticipate them . do n't try to predict them because you 're , you 're , you 're not going to , you 're not going to be able to do those thing . you 're going to make thing worse . okay . so right now , just give this a chance . right now , the recommender system are the creepy people in the shadow watching your every move . so they 're looking at trace of you . they 're not directly interacting with you , sort of the , your close friend and family , the way they know you is by having conversation , by actually having interaction back and forth . do you think there 's a place for recommender system sort of to step , cause you , you just emphasize the value of human to human connection , but yeah , just give it a chance , ai human connection . is there a role for an ai system to have conversation with you in term of , to try to figure out what kind of music you like , not by just watching what you listening to , but actually having a conversation , natural language or otherwise . yeah , no , i 'm , i 'm , so i 'm not against it . i just wanted to push back against the , maybe you 're saying you have option for facebook . so there i think it 's misplaced , but , but i think that distributing , yeah , no , so good for you . go for it . that 's a hard spot to be in . yeah , no , good . human interaction , like on our daily , the context around me in my own home is something that i do n't want some big company to know about at all , but i would be more than happy to have technology help me with it . which kind of technology ? well , you know , just , alexa , amazon , well , a good , alexa 's done right . and i think alexa is a research platform right now more than anything else . but alexa done right , you know , could do thing like i , i leave the water running in my garden and i say , hey , alexa , the water 's running in my garden . and even have alexa figure out that that mean when my wife come home , that she should be told about that . that 's a little bit of a reasoning . i would call that ai and by any kind of stretch , it 's a little bit of reasoning and it actually kind of would make my life a little easier and better . and you know , i do n't , i would n't call this a wow moment , but i kind of think that overall rise human happiness up to have that kind of thing . but not when you 're lonely , alexa , knowing loneliness . no , no , i do n't want alexa to be , feel intrusive . and i do n't want just the designer of the system to kind of work all this out . i really want to have a lot of control and i want transparency and control . and if a company can stand up and give me that in the context of new technology , i think they 're good . first of all , be way more successful than our current generation . and like i said , i wa mentioning microsoft , i really think they 're , they 're pivoting to kind of be the trusted old uncle , but you know , i think that they get that this is a way to go , that if you let people find technology , empowers them to have more control and have and have control , not just over privacy , but over this rich set of interaction , that that people are going to like that a lot more . and that 's , that 's the right business model going forward . what doe control over privacy look like ? do you think you should be able to just view all the data that ? no , it 's much more than that . i mean , first of all , it should be an individual decision . some people do n't want privacy . they want their whole life out there . other people 's want it . privacy is not a zero one . it 's not a legal thing . it 's not just about which data is available , which is not . i like to recall to people that , you know , a couple hundred year ago , everyone , there wa not really big city , everyone lived in on the countryside and village and village . everybody knew everything about you . very , you did n't have any privacy . is that bad ? are we better off now ? well , you know , arguably no , because what did you get for that loss of certain kind of privacy ? well , people help each other if they , because they know everything about you . they know something 's bad 's happening , they will help you with that . right . and now you live in a big city , no one know about that . you get no help . so it kind of depends the answer . i want certain people who i trust and there should be relationship . i should kind of manage all those , but who know what about me ? i should have some agency there . it should n't , i should n't be a drift in a sea of technology where i have no agency . i do n't want to go reading thing and checking box . so i do n't know how to do that . and i 'm not a privacy researcher per se . i just , i recognize the vast complexity of this . it 's not just technology . it 's not just legal scholar meeting technologist . there 's got ta be kind of a whole layer around it . and so i , when i alluded to this emerging engineering field , this is a big part of it . when electrical engineering came , i 'm not one around at the time , but you just did n't plug electricity into wall and all kind of work . you do n't have to have like underwriter laboratory that reassured you that that plug 's not going to burn up your house and that that machine will do this and that and everything . there 'll be whole people who can install thing . there 'll be people who can watch the installers . there 'll be a whole layer , you know , an onion of these kind of thing . and for thing a deep and interesting a privacy , which is a least a interesting a electricity , that 's going to take decade to kind of work out , but it 's going to require a lot of new structure that we do n't have right now . so it 's kind of hard to talk about it . and you 're saying there 's a lot of money to be made if you get it right . so something you should look at . a lot of money to be made in all these thing that provide human service and people recognize them a useful part of their life . so yeah . so yeah , the dialogue sometimes go from the exuberant technologist to the no technology is good , kind of . and that 's , you know , in our public discourse , you know , and a far a you see too much of this kind of thing and the sober discussion in the middle , which are the challenge he want to have or where we need to be having our conversation . and you know , there 's just not actually , there 's not many forum forum for those . you know , there 's , that 's , that 's kind of what i would look for . maybe i could go and i could read a comment section of something and it would actually be this kind of dialogue going back and forth . you do n't see much of this , right ? which is why actually there 's a resurgence of podcasts out of all , because people are really hungry for conversation , but there 's technology is not helping much . so comment section of anything , including youtube is not hurting and not helping .\",\n          \"we are becoming cyborg . our brain are fundamentally changed . everyone who grew up with electronics , we are fundamentally different from previous , from homo sapiens . i call u homo techno . i think we have evolved into homo techno , which is like essentially a new specie . previous technology , i mean , may have even been more profound and moved u to a certain degree , but i think the computer are what make u homo techno . i think this is what , it 's a brain augmentation . so it like allows for actual evolution . like the computer accelerate the degree to which all the other technology can also be accelerated . would you classify yourself a a homo sapien or a homo techno ? definitely homo techno . so you 're one of the earliest of the specie . i think most of u are . the following is a conversation with grime , an artist , musician , songwriter , producer , director , and a fascinating human being who think a lot about both the history and the future of human civilization . studying the dark period of our past to help form an optimistic vision of our future . this is the lex friedman podcast . to support it , please check out our sponsor in the description . and now , dear friend , here 's grime . oh yeah , the cloud lifter , there you go . there you go . you know your stuff . have you ever used a cloud lifter ? yeah , i actually , this microphone cloud lifter is what michael jackson used , so . no , really ? yeah , this is like thriller and stuff . this mic and a cloud lifter ? yeah , it 's a incredible microphone . it 's very flattering on vocal . i 've used this a lot . it 's great for demo vocal . it 's great in a room . sometimes it 's easier to record vocal if you 're just in a room and the music 's playing and you just wan na feel it so it 's not in the headphone . and this mic is pretty directional , so i think it 's a good mic for just vibing out and just getting a real good vocal take . just vibing , just in a room . anyway , this is the michael jackson , quincy jones microphone . i feel way more badass now . all right , you wan na just get into it ? i guess so . all right , one of your name , at least in this space and time , is c , like the letter c. and you told me that c mean a lot of thing . it 's the speed of light . it 's the render rate of the universe . it 's yes in spanish . it 's the crescent moon . and it happens to be my favorite programming language because it basically run the world , but it 's also powerful , fast , and it 's dangerous because you can mess thing up really bad with it because of all the pointer . but anyway , which of these association will the name c is the coolest to you ? i mean , to me , the coolest is the speed of light , obviously , or the speed of light . when i say render rate of the universe , i think i mean the speed of light because essentially that 's what we 're rendering at . see , i think we 'll know if we 're in a simulation if the speed of light change because if they can improve their render speed , then . well , it 's already pretty good . it 's already pretty good , but if it improves , then we 'll know , we can probably be like , okay , they 've updated or upgraded . well , it 's fast enough for u human because it seems immediate . there 's no delay , there 's no latency in term of u human on earth interacting with thing . but if you 're like intergalactic specie operating on a much larger scale , then you 're gon na start noticing some weird stuff . or if you can operate in like around a black hole , then you 're gon na start to see some render issue . you ca n't go faster than the speed of light , correct ? so it really limit our ability or one 's ability to travel space . theoretically , you can , you have wormhole . so there 's nothing in general relativity that precludes faster than the speed of light travel . but it just seems you 're gon na have to do some really funky stuff with very heavy thing that have like weirdness , that have basically terror in space time . we do n't know how to do that . do navigator know how to do it ? do navigator ? yeah . folding space , basically making wormhole . so the name c. yes . who are you ? do you think of yourself a multiple people ? are you one person ? do you know , like in this morning , were you a different person than you are tonight ? we are , i should say , recording this basically at midnight , which is awesome . yes , thank you so much . i think i 'm about eight hour late . no , you 're right on time . good morning . this is the beginning of a new day soon . anyway , are you the same person you were in the morning and the evening ? is there multiple people in there ? do you think of yourself a one person ? or maybe you have no clue ? or are you just a giant mystery to yourself ? okay , these are really intense question , but . let 's go , let 's go . because i asked this myself , like look in the mirror , who are you ? people tell you to just be yourself , but what doe that even mean ? i mean , i think my personality change with everyone i talk to . so i have a very inconsistent personality . yeah . person to person , so the interaction , your personality materializes . or my mood . like i 'll go from being like a megalomaniac to being like , you know , just like a total hermit who is very shy . so some combinatorial combination of your mood and the person you 're interacting with . yeah , mood and people i 'm interacting with . but i think everyone 's like that . maybe not . well , not everybody acknowledges it and able to introspect it . who brings out , what kind of person , what kind of mood brings out the best in you ? a an artist and a a human . can you introspect this ? like my best friend , like people i can , when i 'm like super confident and i know that they 're gon na understand everything i 'm saying , so like my best friend , then when i can start being really funny , that 's always my like peak mode . but it 's like , yeah , take a lot to get there . let 's talk about constraint . you 've talked about constraint and limit . do those help you out a an artist or a a human being ? or do they get in the way ? do you like the constraint ? so in creating music , in creating art , in living life , do you like the constraint that this world put on you ? or do you hate them ? if constraint are moving , then you 're good , right ? like it 's like a we are progressing with technology , we 're changing the constraint of like artistic creation . you know , making video and music and stuff is getting a lot cheaper . there 's constantly new technology and new software that 's making it faster and easier . we have so much more freedom than we had in the 70 . like when michael jackson , you know , when they recorded thriller with this microphone , like they had to use a mixing desk and all this stuff . and like probably even get in a studio , it 's probably really expensive and you have to be a really good singer and you have to know how to use like the mixing desk and everything . and now i can just , you know , make i 've made a whole album on this computer . i have a lot more freedom , but then i 'm also constrained in different way because there 's like literally million more artist . it 's like a much bigger playing field . it 's just like , i also , i did n't learn music . i 'm not a natural musician . so i do n't know anything about actual music . i just know about like the computer . so i 'm really kind of just like messing around and like trying thing out . well , yeah , i mean , but the nature of music is changing . so you 're saying you do n't know actual music , what music is changing . music is becoming , you 've talked about this , is becoming , it 's like merging with technology . yes . it 's becoming something more than just like the note on a piano . it 's becoming some weird composition that requires engineering skill , programming skill , some kind of human robot interaction skill , and still some of the same thing that michael jackson had , which is like a good ear for a good sense of taste of what 's good and not the final thing when it 's put together . like you 're allowed , you 're enabled , empowered with a laptop to layer stuff , to start like layering insane amount of stuff . and it 's super easy to do that . i do think music production is a really underrated art form . i feel like people really do n't appreciate it . when i look at publishing split , the way that people like pay producer and stuff , it 's super , producer are just deeply underrated . like so many of the song that are popular right now or for the last 20 year , like part of the reason they 're popular is because the production is really interesting or really sick or really cool . and it 's like , i do n't think listener , like people just do n't really understand what music production is . it 's not , it 's sort of like this weird , discombobulated art form . it 's not like a formal , because it 's so new , there is n't like a formal training path for it . it 's mostly driven by like autodidact . like it 's like almost everyone i know who 's good at production , like they did n't go to music school or anything . they just taught themselves . are they 're mostly different ? like the music producer , you know , is there some commonality that time together or are they all just different kind of weirdo ? cause i just , i just hung out with rick rubin . i do n't know if you 've . yeah , i mean , rick rubin is like literally one of the god of music production . like he 's one of the people who first , you know , who like made music production , you know , made the production a important a the actual lyric or the note . but the thing he doe , which is interesting , i do n't know if you can speak to that , but just hanging out with him , he seems to just sit there in silence , close his eye and listen . it 's like , he almost doe nothing . and that nothing somehow give you freedom to be the best version of yourself . so that 's music production somehow too , which is like encouraging you to do le , to simplify , to like push towards minimalism . i mean , i guess , i mean , i work differently from rick rubin cause rick rubin produce for other artist , whereas like i mostly produce for myself . so it 's a very different situation . i also think rick rubin , he 's in that , i would say advanced category of producer where like you 've like earned your , you can have an engineer and stuff and people like do the stuff for you . but i usually just like do stuff myself . so you 're the engineer , the producer and the artist . yeah , i guess i would say i 'm in the era , like the post rick rubin era . like i come from the kind of like skrillex school of thought , which is like where you are . yeah , the engineer , producer , artist . like where , i mean lately , sometimes i 'll work with a producer now . i 'm gently sort of delicately starting to collaborate a bit more , but like i think i 'm kind of from the , like the whatever 2010s explosion of thing where everything became available on the computer and you kind of got this like lone wizard energy thing going . so you embraced being the loneliness . is the loneliness somehow an engine of creativity ? like , so most of your stuff , most of your creative quote unquote genius in quote is in the privacy of your mind . yes , well , it wa , but here 's the thing . i wa talking to daniel eck and he said , he 's like most artist , they have about 10 year , like 10 good year . and then they usually stop making their like vital shit . and i feel like i 'm sort of like nearing the end of my 10 year on my own . so you have to become somebody else . now i 'm like , i 'm in the process of becoming somebody else and reinventing . when i work with other people , because i 've never worked with other people , i find that i make like , that i 'm exceptionally rejuvenated and making like some of the most vital work i 've ever made . so , because i think another human brain is like one of the best tool you can possibly find . like . it 's a funny way to put it , i love it . it 's like if a tool is like , you know , whatever hp plus one or like add some like stats to your character , like another human brain will like square it instead of just like adding something . double up the experience point , i love this . we should also mention we 're playing tavern music before this and which i love , which i first , i think i first . you had to stop the tavern music . yeah , because it doe n't , the audio . okay , okay . but it make . yeah , it 'll make the podcast annoying . add it in post , add it in post . no one will want to listen to the podcast . they probably would , but it make me , it reminds me like of a video game , like a role playing video game where you have experience point . there 's something really joyful about wandering place like elder scroll , like skyrim , just exploring these landscape in another world and then you get experience point and you can work on different skill and somehow you progress in life . i do n't know , it 's simple . it doe n't have some of the messy complexity of life and there 's usually a bad guy you can fight in skyrim . it 's dragon and so on . i 'm sure in elden ring , there 's a bunch of monster you can fight . i love that . i feel like elden ring , i feel like this is a good analogy to music production though because it 's like , i feel like the engineer and the people creating these open world are , it 's sort of like similar to people , to music producer where it 's like this hidden archetype that like no one really understands what they do and no one really know who they are , but they 're like , it 's like the artist engineer because it 's like , it 's both art and fairly complex engineering . well , you 're saying they do n't get enough credit . are n't you kind of changing that by becoming the person doing everything ? are n't you , is n't the engineer ? well , i mean , others have gone before me . i 'm not , you know , there 's like timbaland and skrillex and there 's all these people that are like , you know , very famous for this , but i just think the general , i think people get confused about what it is and just do n't really know what it is per se and it 's just when i see a song , like when there 's like a hit song , like i 'm just trying to think of like , just going for like even just a basic pop hit , like , what 's it ? like rule by dua lipa or something . the production on that is actually like really crazy . i mean , the song is also great , but it 's like the production is exceptionally memorable . like , you know , and it 's just like no one , i ca n't , i do n't even know who produced that song . it 's just like , is n't part of like the rhetoric of how we just discus the creation of art . we just sort of like do n't consider the music producer because i think the music producer used to be more just simply recording thing . yeah , that 's interesting because when you think about movie , we talk about the actor and the actress , but we also talk about the director . we do n't talk about like that with the music a often . the beatles music producer wa one of the first kind of guy , one of the first people sort of introducing crazy sound design into pop music . i forget his name . he ha the same , i forget his name , but you know , like he wa doing all the weird stuff like dropping piano and like , yeah . oh , to get the , yeah , yeah , yeah , to get the sound , to get the authentic sound . what about lyric ? you think those , where did they fit into how important they are ? i wa heartbroken to learn that elvis did n't write his song . i wa very mad . a lot of people do n't write their song . i understand this , but . but here 's the thing . i feel like there 's this desire for authenticity . i used to be like really mad when like people would n't write or produce their music and i 'd be like , that 's fake . and then i realized there 's all this like weird bitterness and like agronus in art about authenticity . but i had this kind of like weird realization recently where i started thinking that like art is sort of a decentralized collective thing . like art is kind of a conversation with all the artist that have ever lived before you . you know , like it 's like , you 're really just sort of , it 's not like anyone 's reinventing the wheel here . like you 're kind of just taking , you know , thousand of year of art and like running it through your own little algorithm and then like making your interpretation of it . you just joined the conversation with all the other artist that came before . it 's just a beautiful way to look at it . like , and it 's like , i feel like everyone 's always like , there 's all this copyright and ip and this and that or authenticity . and it 's just like , i think we need to stop seeing this a this like egotistical thing of like , oh , the creative genius , the lone creative genius or this or that . because it 's like , i think art should n't be about that . i think art is something that sort of brings humanity together . and it 's also , art is also kind of the collective memory of human . it 's like , we do n't give a fuck about whatever ancient egypt , like how much grain got sent that day and sending the record and like , you know , like who went where and , you know , how many shield needed to be produced for this . like we just remember their art . and it 's like , you know , it 's like in our day to day life , there 's all this stuff that seems more important than art because it help u function and survive . but when all this is gone , like the only thing that 's really gon na be left is the art . the technology will be obsolete . that 's so fascinating . like the human will be dead . that is true . a good compression of human history is the art we 've generated across the different century , the different millennium . so when the alien come . when the alien come , they 're gon na find the hieroglyphic and the pyramid . i mean , art could be broadly defined . they might find like the engineering marvel , the bridge , the rocket , the . i guess i sort of classify though . architecture is art too . i consider engineering in those format to be art , for sure . it suck that like digital art is easier to delete . so if there 's an apocalypse , a nuclear war , that can disappear . yes . and the physical . there 's something still valuable about the physical manifestation of art . that suck that like music , for example , ha to be played by somebody . yeah , i do think we should have a foundation type situation where we like , you know how we have like seed bank up in the north and stuff ? like we should probably have like a solar powered or geothermal little bunker that like ha all human knowledge . you mentioned daniel ek and spotify . what do you think about that a an artist ? what 's spotify ? is that empowering ? to me , spotify a a consumer is super exciting . it make it easy for me to access music from all kind of artist , get to explore all kind of music , make it super easy to sort of curate my own playlist and have fun with all that . it wa so liberating to let go . you know , i used to collect , you know , album and cd and so on , like horde album . yeah . like they matter . but the reality you could , you know , that wa really liberating that i could let go of that . and letting go of the album you 're kind of collecting allows you to find new music , exploring new artist and all that kind of stuff . but i know from a perspective of an artist that could be , like you mentioned , competition could be a kind of constraint because there 's more and more and more artist on the platform . i think it 's better that there 's more artist . i mean , again , this might be propaganda because this is all from a conversation with daniel ek . so this could easily be propaganda . we 're all a victim of somebody 's propaganda . so let 's just accept this . but daniel ek wa telling me that , you know , to understand really difficult concept just in a very different way , like an emotional intelligence about something deep within ? oh yeah , no , like if x hurt , like if x bite me really hard and i 'm like , ow , like he get , he 's sad . he 's like sad if he hurt me by accident . yeah . which he 's huge , so he hurt me a lot by accident . yeah , that 's so interesting that that mind emerges and he and child do n't really have memory of that time . so we ca n't even have a conversation with them about it . yeah , i just thank god they do n't have a memory of this time because like , think about like , i mean with our youngest baby , like it 's like , i 'm like , have you read the sci fi short story , i have no mouth but i must scream ? good title , no . oh man , i mean , you should read that . i have no mouth but i must scream . i hate getting into this rocco 's basilisk shit . it 's kind of a story about the , about like an ai that 's like torturing someone in eternity and they have like no body . the way they describe it , it sort of sound like what it feel like , like being a baby , like you 're conscious and you 're just getting input from everywhere and you have no muscle and you 're like jelly and you like ca n't move and you try to like communicate , but you ca n't communicate and we 're , and like , you 're just like in this like hell state . i think it 's good we ca n't remember that . like my little baby is just exiting that , like she 's starting to like get muscle and have more like autonomy , but like watching her go through the opening phase , i wa like , i wa like , this doe not seem good . oh , you think it 's kind of like . like i think it suck . i think it might be really violent . like violent , mentally violent , psychologically violent . consciousness emerging , i think is a very violent thing . i never thought about that . i think it 's possible that we all carry quite a bit of trauma from it that we do n't , i think that would be a good thing to study because i think if , i think addressing that trauma , like , i think that might be . oh , you mean like echo of it are still there in the shadow somewhere . i think it 's got ta be , i feel this , this help , the helplessness , the like existential and that like fear of being in like an unknown place bombarded with input and being completely helpless , like that 's got ta be somewhere deep in your brain and that ca n't be good for you . what do you think consciousness is ? this whole conversation ha impossibly difficult question . what do you think it is ? debbie said this is like so hard . yeah , we talked about music for like two minute . all right . no , i 'm so , i 'm just over music . i 'm over music . yeah , i still like it . it ha it purpose . no , i love music . i mean , music 's the greatest thing ever . it 's my favorite thing . but i just like every interview is like , what is your process ? like , i do n't know . i 'm just done . i ca n't do anything . i do want to ask you about able to live . oh , i 'll tell you about ableton because ableton 's sick . no one ha ever asked about ableton though . yeah , well , because i just need tech support mainly . i can help you . i can help you with your ableton tech . anyway , from ableton back to consciousness . what do you , do you think this is a thing that only human are capable of ? can robot be conscious ? can , like when you think about entity , you think there 's alien out there that are conscious ? like is conscious , what is consciousness ? there 's this terrence mckenna quote that i 've found that i fucking love . am i allowed to swear on here ? yes . nature love courage . you make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacle . dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under . it will lift you up . this is the trick . this is what all these teacher and philosopher who really counted , who really touched the alchemical gold , this is what they understood . this is the shamanic dance in the waterfall . this is how magic is done . by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it 's a feather bed . yeah . and for this reason , i do think there are no technological limit . i think like what is already happening here , this is like impossible . this is insane . and we 've done this in a very limited amount of time . and we 're accelerating the rate at which we 're doing this . so i think digital consciousness , it 's inevitable . and we may not be able to even understand what that mean , but i like hurling yourself into the abyss . so we 're surrounded by all this mystery and we just keep hurling ourselves into it , like fearlessly and keep discovering cool shit . yeah . like , i just think it 's like , like who even know if the law of physic , the law of physic are probably just the current , like a i wa saying , speed of light is the current render rate . it 's like , if we 're in a simulation , they 'll be able to upgrade that . like i sort of suspect when we made the james webb telescope , like part of the reason we made that is because we had an upgrade , you know ? and so now more of space ha been rendered so we can see more of it now . yeah , but i think human are super , super , super limited cognitively . so i wonder if we 'll be allowed to create more intelligent being that can see more of the universe a their render rate is upgraded . maybe we 're cognitively limited . everyone keep talking about how we 're cognitively limited and ai is gon na render u obsolete , but it 's like , you know , like this is not the same thing a like an amoeba becoming an alligator . like , it 's like , if we create ai , again , that 's intelligent design . that 's literally all religion are based on god that create consciousness . like we are god making . like what we are doing is incredibly profound . and like , even if we ca n't compute , even if we 're so much worse than them , like just like unfathomably worse than like , you know , an omnipotent kind of ai , it 's like we , i do not think that they would just think that we are stupid . i think that they would recognize the profundity of what we have accomplished . are we the god or are they the god in our personality ? i mean , we 're kind of the guy . it 's complicated . it 's complicated . like we 're . but they would acknowledge the value . well , i hope they acknowledge the value of paying respect to the creative ancestor . i think they would think it 's cool . i think if curiosity is a trait that we can quantify and put into ai , then i think if ai are curious , then they will be curious about u and they will not be hateful or dismissive of u . they might , you know , see u a , i do n't know . it 's like , i 'm not like , oh , fuck these dog . let 's just kill all the dog . i love dog . dog have great utility . dog like provide a lot of . we make friend with them . we have a deep connection with them . we anthropomorphize them . like we have a real love for dog , for cat and so on for some reason , even though they 're intellectually much le than u . and i think there is something sacred about u because it 's like , if you look at the universe , like the whole universe is like cold and dead and sort of robotic . and it 's like , you know , ai intelligence , you know , it 's kind of more like the universe . it 's like cold and you know , logical and you know , abiding by the law of physic and whatever . but like , we 're this like loosey goosey , weird art thing that happened . and i think it 's beautiful . and like , i think even if we , i think one of the value , if consciousness is a thing that is most worth preserving , which i think is the case , i think consciousness , i think if there 's any kind of like religious or spiritual thing , it should be that consciousness is sacred . like , then , you know , i still think even if ai render u obsolete and we , climate change , it 's too bad and we get hit by a comet and we do n't become a multi planetary specie fast enough , but like ai is able to populate the universe . like i imagine , like if i wa an ai , i would find more planet that are capable of hosting biological life form and like recreate them . because we 're fun to watch . yeah , we 're fun to watch . yeah , but i do believe that ai can have some of the same magic of consciousness within it . because consciousness , we do n't know what it is . so , you know , there 's some kind of . or it might be a different magic . it might be like a strange , a strange , different . right . because they 're not gon na have hormone . like i feel like a lot of our magic is hormonal kind of . i do n't know , i think some of our magic is the limitation , the constraint . and within that , the hormone and all that kind of stuff , the finiteness of life , and then we get given our limitation , we get to come up with creative solution of how to dance around those limitation . we partner up like penguin against the cold . we fall in love , and then love is ultimately some kind of , allows u to delude ourselves that we 're not mortal and finite , and that life is not ultimately , you live alone , you 're born alone , you die alone . and then love is like for a moment or for a long time , forgetting that . and so we come up with all these creative hack that make life like fascinatingly fun . yeah , yeah , yeah , fun , yeah . and then ai might have different kind of fun . yes . and hopefully our fun intersect once in a while . i think there would be a little intersection of the fun . yeah . yeah . what do you think is the role of love in the human condition ? i think . why , is it useful ? is it useful like a hack , or is this like fundamental to what it mean to be human , the capacity to love ? i mean , i think love is the evolutionary mechanism that is like beginning the intelligent design . like i wa just reading about , do you know about kropotkin ? he 's like an anarchist , like old russian anarchist . i live next door to michael malice . i do n't know if you know who that is . he 's an anarchist . he 's a modern day anarchist . okay . anarchist are fun . i 'm kind of getting into anarchism a little bit . this is probably not a good route to be taking , but . oh no , i think if you 're , listen , you should expose yourself to idea . there 's no harm to thinking about idea . i think anarchist challenge system in interesting way , and they think in interesting way . it 's just a good for the soul . it 's like refreshes your mental palette . i do n't think we should actually , i would n't actually ascribe to it , but i 've never actually gone deep on anarchy a a philosophy , so i 'm doing . you should still think about it though . when you read , when you listen , because i 'm reading about the russian revolution a lot , and there wa the soviet and lenin and all that , but then there wa kropotkin and his anarchist sect , and they were sort of interesting because he wa kind of a technocrat actually . he wa like , woman can be more equal if we have appliance . he wa really into using technology to reduce the amount of work people had to do . but so kropotkin wa a biologist or something . he studied animal . and he wa really at the time like , i think it 's nature magazine . i think it might 've even started a a russian magazine , but he wa publishing study . everyone wa really into darwinism at the time and survival of the fittest , and war is the mechanism by which we become better . and it wa this real cementing this idea in society that violence kill the weak , and that 's how we become better . and then kropotkin wa kind of interesting because he wa looking at instance , he wa finding all these instance in nature where animal were like helping each other and stuff . and he wa like , actually love is a survival mechanism . like there 's so many instance in the animal kingdom where like cooperation and like helping weaker creature and all this stuff is actually an evolutionary mechanism . i mean , you even look at child rearing . like child rearing is like immense amount of just love and goodwill . and just like , there 's no immediate , you 're not getting any immediate feedback of like winning . it 's not competitive . it 's literally , it 's like we actually use love a an evolutionary mechanism just a much a we use war . and i think we 've like missing the other part and we 've reoriented , we 've culturally reoriented like science and philosophy ha oriented itself around darwinism a little bit too much . and the kropotkin model , i think is equally valid . like it 's like cooperation and love and stuff is just a essential for specie survival and evolution . it should be a more powerful survival mechanism in the context of evolution . and it come back to like , we think engineering is so much more important than motherhood , but it 's like , if you lose the motherhood , the engineering mean nothing . we have no more human . it 's like , i think our society should , the survival of the , the way we see , we conceptualize evolution should really change to also include this idea , i guess . yeah , there 's some weird thing that seems irrational that is also core to what it mean to be human . so love is one such thing . they could make you do a lot of irrational thing , but that depth of connection and that loyalty is a powerful thing . are they irrational or are they rational ? like , it 's like , is , you know , maybe losing out on some thing in order to like keep your family together or in order , like , it 's like , what are our actual value ? well , right , i mean , the rational thing is if you have a cold economist perspective , you know , motherhood or sacrificing your career for love , you know , in term of salary , in term of economic wellbeing , in term of flourishing of you a a human being , that could be seen on some kind of metric a a irrational decision , suboptimal decision , but there 's the manifestation of love could be the optimal thing to do . there 's a kind of saying , save one life , save the world . that 's the thing that doctor often face , which is like . well , it 's considered irrational because the profit model doe n't include social good . yes , yeah . so if a profit model includes social good , then suddenly these would be rational decision . might be difficult to , you know , it requires a shift in our thinking about profit and might be difficult to measure social good . yes , but we 're learning to measure a lot of thing . yeah , digitizing a lot of thing . where we 're actually , you know , quantifying vision and stuff . like we 're like , you know , like you go on facebook and they can , like facebook can pretty much predict our behavior . like we 're , a surprising amount of thing that seem like mysterious consciousness soul thing have been quantified at this point . so surely we can quantify these other thing . yeah . but a more and more of u are moving the digital space , i wanted to ask you about something . from a fan perspective , i kind of , you know , you a a musician , you a an online personality , it seems like you have all these identity and you play with them . one of the cool thing about the internet , it seems like you can play with identity . so a we move into the digital world more and more , maybe even in the so called metaverse . i mean , i love the metaverse and i love the idea , but like the way this ha all played out did n't go well and people are mad about it . and i think we need to like . i think that 's temporary . i think it 's temporary . just like , you know how all the celebrity got together and sang the song imagine by jeff leonard and everyone started hating the song imagine . i 'm hoping that 's temporary because it 's a damn good song . so i think it 's just temporary . like once you actually have virtual world , whatever they 're called metaverse or otherwise , it becomes , i do n't know . well , we do have virtual world . like video game , elden ring . have you played elden ring ? you have n't played elden ring ? i 'm really afraid of playing that game . literally amazed . it look way too fun . it look i would wan na go there and stay there forever . it 's yeah , so fun . it 's so nice . oh man , yeah . so that 's the , yeah , that 's a metaverse . that 's a metaverse , but you 're not really , how immersive is it in the sense that , doe the three dimension like virtual reality integration necessary ? can we really just take our , close our eye and kind of plug in in the 2d screen and become that other being for time and really enjoy that journey that we take ? and we almost become that . you 're no longer c , i 'm no longer lex , you 're that creature , whatever the hell it is in that game . yeah , that is that . i mean , that 's why i love those video game . i really do become those people for a time . but like , it seems like with the idea of the metaverse , the idea of the digital space , well , even on twitter , you get a chance to be somebody for prolonged period of time like across a lifespan . you know , you have a twitter account for year , for decade and you 're that person . i do n't know if that 's a good thing . i feel very tormented by it . by twitter specifically . by social medium representation of you . i feel like the public perception of me ha gotten so distorted that i find it kind of disturbing . it 's one of the thing that 's disincentivizing me from like wanting to keep making art because i 'm just like , i 've completely lost control of the narrative . and the narrative is , some of it is my own stupidity , but a lot , like some of it ha just been like hijacked by force far beyond my control . i kind of got in over my head in thing . like i 'm just a random indian musician , but i just got like dragged into geopolitical matter and like financial , like the stock market and shit . and so it 's just like , it 's just , there are very powerful people who have at various point in time had very vested interest in making me seem insane and i ca n't fucking fight that . and i just like , people really want their celebrity figure to like be consistent and stay the same . and like people have a lot of like emotional investment in certain thing . and like , first of all , like i 'm like artificially more famous than i should be . is n't everybody who 's famous artificially famous ? no , but like i should be like a weird niche indie thing . and i make pretty challenging , i do challenging weird fucking shit a lot . and i accidentally by proxy got like foisted into sort of like weird celebrity culture , but like i can not be medium trained . they have put me through so many hour of medium training . i would love to see bf fly in that wall . i ca n't do , like when i do , i try so hard and i like learn this thing and i like got it . and i 'm like , i got it , i got it , i got it . but i just ca n't stop saying , like my mouth just say thing like , and it 's just like , and i just do , i just do thing . i just do crazy thing . like i 'm , i just , i need to do crazy thing . and it 's just , i should not be , it 's too jarring for people and the contradictory stuff . and then all the by association , like , you know , it 's like i 'm in a very weird position and my public image , the avatar of me is now this totally crazy thing that is so lost from my control . so you feel the burden of the avatar having to be static . so the avatar on twitter or the avatar on instagram on these social platform is a a burden . it becomes like , cause like people do n't want to accept a changing avatar , a chaotic avatar . avatar is a stupid shit sometimes . they think the avatar is morally wrong or they think the avatar , and maybe it ha been , and like i question it all the time . like , i 'm like , like , i do n't know if everyone 's right and i 'm wrong . i do n't know , like , but you know , a lot of time people ascribe intention to thing , the worst possible intention . at this point , people think i 'm , you know , but which is fine . all kind of word , yes . yes , and it 's fine . i 'm not complaining about it , but i 'm just , it 's a curiosity to me that we live these double , triple , quadruple life and i have this other life that is like more people know my other life than my real life , which is interesting . probably , i mean , you too , i guess , probably . yeah , but i have the luxury . so we have all different , you know , like i do n't know what i 'm doing . there is an avatar and you 're mediating who you are through that avatar . i have the nice luxury , not the luxury , maybe by intention of not trying really hard to make sure there 's no difference between the avatar and the private person . do you wear a suit all the time ? yeah . you do wear a suit ? not all the time . recently , because i get recognized a lot , i have to not wear the suit to hide . i 'm such an introvert , i 'm such a social anxiety and all that kind of stuff , so i have to hide away . i love wearing a suit because it make me feel like i 'm taking the moment seriously . like i 'm , i do n't know . it make me feel like a weirdo in the best possible way . suit feel great , every time i wear a suit , i 'm like , i do n't know why i 'm not doing this more . fashion in general , if you 're doing it for yourself , i do n't know , it 's a really awesome thing . but yeah , i think there is definitely a painful way to use social medium and an empowering way . and i do n't know if any of u know which is which . so we 're trying to figure that out . some people , i think doja cat is incredible at it . incredible , like just masterful . i do n't know if you like follow that . so okay , so not taking anything seriously , joking , absurd , humor , that kind of thing . i think doja cat might be like the greatest living comedian right now . like i 'm more entertained by doja cat than actual comedian . like she 's really fucking funny on the internet . she 's just great at social medium . it 's just , you know . yeah , the nature of humor , like humor on social medium is also a beautiful thing , the absurdity . the absurdity . and meme , like i just wan na like take a moment . i love , like when we 're talking about art and credit and authenticity , i love that there 's this , i mean now meme are like , they 're no longer , like meme are n't like new , but it 's still this emergent art form that is completely egoless and anonymous and we just do n't know who made any of it . and it 's like the forefront of comedy and it 's just totally anonymous and it just feel really beautiful . it just feel like this beautiful collective human art project that 's like this like decentralized comedy thing that just make meme add so much to my day and many people 's day . and it 's just like , i do n't know . i do n't think people ever , i do n't think we stop enough and just appreciate how sick it is that meme exist . because also making a whole brand new art form in like the modern era that 's like did n't exist before . like , i mean they sort of existed , but the way that they exist now a like this like , you know , like me and my friend , like we joke that we go like mining for meme or farming for meme , like a video game and like meme dealer and like whatever . like it 's , you know , it 's this whole , meme are this whole like new comedic language . well , it 's this art form . the interesting thing about it is that lame people seem to not be good at meme . like corporate ca n't infiltrate meme . yeah , they really ca n't . they try , they could try . but it 's like , it 's weird cause like . they try so hard and every once in a while , i 'm like fine , like you got a good one . i think i 've seen like one or two good one , but like , yeah , they really ca n't . cause they 're even , corporate is infiltrating web three . it 's making me really sad , but they ca n't infiltrate the meme . and i think there 's something really beautiful about that . that give power , that 's why dogecoin is powerful . it 's like , all right , i 'm gon na f you to sort of anybody who 's trying to centralize , is trying to control the rich people that are trying to roll in and control this , control the narrative . wow , i had n't thought about that , but . how would you fix twitter ? how would you fix social medium for your own ? like you 're an optimist , you 're a positive person . there 's a bit of a cynicism that you have currently about this particular little slice of humanity . i tend to think twitter could be beautiful . i 'm not that cynical about it . i 'm not that cynical about it . i actually refuse to be a cynic on principle . yes . i wa just briefly expressing some personal pathos . personal stuff . it wa just some personal pathos , but like , like . just to vent a little bit , just to speak . i do n't have cancer , i love my family . i have a good life . that is , if that is my biggest , one of my biggest problem . then it 's a good life . yeah , you know , that wa a brief , although i do think there are a lot of issue with twitter just in term of like the public mental health , but due to my proximity to the current drama , i honestly feel that i should not have opinion about this because i think that if elon end up getting twitter , that is a , being the arbiter of truth or public discussion , that is a responsibility . i do not , i am not qualified to be responsible for that . and i do not want to say something that might like dismantle democracy . and so i just like , actually , i actually think i should not have opinion about this because i truly am not , i do n't want to have the wrong opinion about this . and i think i 'm too close to the actual situation wherein i should not have , i have thought in my brain , but i think i am scared by my proximity to this situation . is n't that crazy that a few word that you could say could change world affair and hurt people ? i mean , that 's the nature of celebrity at a certain point that you have to be , you have to a little bit , a little bit , not so much that it destroys you or put too much constraint , but you have to a little bit think about the impact of your word . i mean , we a human , you talk to somebody at a bar , you have to think about the impact of your word . like you can say positive thing , you can say negative thing , you can affect the direction of one life . but on social medium , your word can affect the direction of many life . that 's crazy . it 's a crazy world to live in . it 's worthwhile to consider that responsibility , take it seriously . sometimes just like you did choose kind of silence , choose sort of respectful . like i do have a lot of thought on the matter . i 'm just , i do n't , if my thought are wrong , this is one situation where the stake are high . you mentioned a while back that you were in a cult that 's centered around bureaucracy , so you ca n't really do anything because it involves a lot of paperwork . and i really love a cult that 's just like kafkaesque . yes . just like . i mean , it wa like a joke , but it wa . i know , but i love this idea . the holy rain empire . yeah , it wa just like a kafkaesque pro bureaucracy cult . but i feel like that 's what human civilization is , is that , because when you said that , i wa like , oh , that is kind of what humanity is , is this bureaucracy cult . i do , yeah , i have this theory . i really think that we really , bureaucracy is starting to kill u . and i think like we need to reorient law and stuff . like , i think we just need sunset clause on everything . like , i think the rate of change in culture is happening so fast and the rate of change in technology and everything is happening so fast . it 's like , when you see these hearing about like social medium and cambridge analytica and everyone talking , it 's like , even from that point , so much technological change ha happened from like those hearing . and it 's just like , we 're trying to make all these law now about ai and stuff . i feel like we should be updating thing like every five year . and like one of the big issue in our society right now is we 're just getting bogged down by law and it 's making it very hard to change thing and develop thing . in austin , i do n't wan na speak on this too much , but like one of my friend is working on a housing bill in austin to try to like prevent like a san francisco situation from happening here because obviously we 're getting a little mini san francisco here , like housing price are skyrocketing , it 's causing massive gentrification . this is really bad for anyone who 's not super rich . like , there 's so much bureaucracy . part of the reason this is happening is because you need all these permit to build . it take like year to get permit to like build anything . it 's so hard to build and so there 's very limited housing and there 's a massive influx of people . and it 's just like , you know , this is a microcosm of like problem that are happening all over the world where it 's just like , we 're dealing with law that are like 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 100 , 200 year old and they are no longer relevant and it 's just slowing everything down and causing massive social pain . yeah , but it 's like , it 's also make me sad when i see politician talk about technology and when they do n't really get it . but most importantly , they lack curiosity and like that like inspired excitement about like how stuff work and all that stuff . they 're just like , they see , they have a very cynical view of technology . it 's like tech company are just trying to do evil on the world from their perspective and they have no curiosity about like how recommender system work or how ai system work , natural language processing , how robotics work , how computer vision work , you know . they always take the most cynical possible interpretation of what technology would be used and we should definitely be concerned about that but if you 're constantly worried about that and you 're regulating based on that , you 're just going to slow down all the innovation . i do think a huge priority right now is undoing the bad energy surrounding the emergence of silicon valley . like i think that like a lot of thing were very irresponsible during that time and you know , like even just this current whole thing with twitter and everything , it 's like there ha been a lot of negative outcome from the sort of technocracy boom but one of the thing that 's happening is that like it 's alienating people from wanting to care about technology and i actually think technology is probably some of the better , probably the best . i think we can fix a lot of our problem more easily with technology than with you know , fighting the power that be a a you know , not to go back to the star war quote or the buckminster fuller quote . let 's go to some dark question . if we may for time , what is the darkest place you 've ever gone in your mind ? is there a time , a period of time , a moment that you remember that wa difficult for you ? i mean , when i wa 18 , my best friend died of a heroin overdose and it wa like my , and then shortly after that , one of my other best friend committed suicide and that sort of like coming into adulthood , dealing with two of the most important people in my life dying in extremely disturbing violent way wa a lot . that wa a lot . do you miss them ? yeah , definitely miss them . did that make you think about your own life ? about the finiteness of your own life ? the place your mind can go ? did you ever in the distance , far away contemplate just your own death ? or maybe even taking your own life ? oh never , oh no . i 'm so , i love my life . i can not fathom suicide . i 'm so scared of death . i have n't , i 'm too scared of death . my manager , my manager 's like the most zen guy . my manager 's always like , you need to accept death . you need to accept death . and i 'm like , look , i can do your meditation . i can do the meditation , but i can not accept death . i like , i will fight , i 'm terrified of death . i will like fight . although i actually think death is important . i recently went to this meeting about immortality and in the process of . that 's the actual topic of the meeting ? i 'm sorry . no , no , it wa this girl . it wa a bunch of people working on like anti aging stuff . it wa like some like seminary thing about it . and i went in really excited . i wa like , yeah , like , okay , like , what do you got ? like , how can i live for 500 year or a thousand year ? and then like over the course of the meeting , like it wa sort of like , right . it wa like two or three day after the russian invasion started . and i wa like , man , like , what if putin wa immortal ? like , what if i 'm like , man , maybe immortality , is not good . i mean , like if you get into the later dune stuff , the immortal cause a lot of problem . cause a we were talking about earlier with the music and like brain calcify , like good people could become immortal , but bad people could become immortal . but i also think even the best people power corrupts and power alienates you from like the common human experience and . right , so the people that get more and more powerful . even the best people who like , whose brain are amazing , like i think death might be important . i think death is part of , you know , like i think with ai one thing we might want to consider , i do n't know , when i talk about ai , i 'm such not an expert and probably everyone ha all these idea and they 're already figured out . but when i wa talking . nobody is an expert in anything . see , okay , go ahead . but when i . you were talking about . yeah , but i like , it 's just like , i think some kind of pruning . but it 's a tricky thing because if there 's too much of a focus on youth culture , then you do n't have the wisdom . so i feel like we 're in a tricky , we 're in a tricky moment right now in society where it 's like , we 've really perfected living for a long time . so there 's all these really like old people who are like really voting against the wellbeing of the young people , you know ? and like , it 's like there should n't be all this student dead and we need like healthcare , like universal healthcare and like just voting against like best interest . but then you have all these young people that do n't have the wisdom that are like , yeah , we need communism and stuff . and it 's just like , like literally i got canceled at one point for , i ironically used a stalin quote in my high school yearbook , but it wa actually like a dis against my high school . i saw that . yeah , and people were like , you used to be a stalinist and now you 're a class traitor and it 's like , it 's like , oh man , just like , please google stalin . please google stalin . like , you know . ignoring the lesson of history , yes . and it 's like , we 're in this really weird middle ground where it 's like , we are not finding the happy medium between wisdom and fresh idea and they 're fighting each other . and it 's like , like really , like what we need is like the fresh idea and the wisdom to be like collaborating . and it 's like . what the fighting in a way is the searching for the happy medium . and in a way , maybe we are finding the happy medium . maybe that 's what the happy medium look like . and for ai system , there ha to be , it 's , you know , you have the reinforcement learning , you have the dance between exploration and exploitation , sort of doing crazy stuff to see if there 's something better than what you think is the optimal and then doing the optimal thing and dancing back and forth from that . you would , stuart russell , i do n't know if you know that , is ai guy with , think about sort of how to control super intelligent ai system . and his idea is that we should inject uncertainty and sort of humility into ai system that they never , a they get wiser and wiser and wiser and more intelligent , they 're never really sure . they always doubt themselves . and in some sense , when you think of young people , that 's a mechanism for doubt . it 's like , it 's how society doubt whether the thing it ha converged towards is the right answer . so the voice of the young people is a society asking itself a question . the way i 've been doing stuff for the past 50 year , maybe it 's the wrong way . and so you can have all of that within one ai system . i also think , though , that we need to , i mean , actually , that 's actually really interesting and really cool . but i also think there 's a fine balance of , i think we maybe also overvalue the idea that the old system are always bad . and i think there are thing that we are perfecting and we might be accidentally overthrowing thing that we actually have gotten to a good point . just because we value disruption so much and we value fighting against the generation before u so much that there 's also an aspect of , sometimes we 're taking two step forward , one step back because , okay , maybe we kind of did solve this thing and now we 're like fucking it up , you know ? and so i think there 's like a middle ground there too . yeah , we 're in search of that happy medium . let me ask you a bunch of crazy question , okay ? all right . you can answer in a short way or in a long way . what 's the scariest thing you 've ever done ? these question are gon na be ridiculous . something tiny or something big . something big , skydiving or touring your first record , going on this podcast . i 've had two crazy brush , like really scary brush with death where i randomly got away on scay . i do n't know if i should talk about those on here . well , i do n't know . i think i might be the luckiest person alive though . like this might be too dark for a podcast though . i feel like , i do n't know if this is like good content for a podcast . i do n't know what is good content . it might hijack . here 's a safer one . i mean , having a baby really scared me . before . just the birth process . surgery , like just having a baby is really scary . so just like the medical aspect of it , not the responsibility . were you ready for the responsibility ? did you , were you ready to be a mother ? all the beautiful thing that come with motherhood that you were talking about . all the change and all that , were you ready for that ? or did you feel ready for that ? no , i think it took about nine month to start getting ready for it . and i 'm still getting more ready for it because now you keep realizing more thing a they start getting . a the consciousness grows . and stuff you did n't notice with the first one , now that you 've seen the first one older , you 're noticing it more . like the sort of like existential horror of coming into consciousness with baby y or baby sailor mar or whatever . she ha like so many name at this point that it 's , we really need to probably settle on one . if you could be someone else for a day , someone alive today , but somebody you have n't met yet , who would you be ? would i be modeling their brain state or would i just be in their body ? you can choose the degree to which you 're modeling their brain state . cause you can still take a third person perspective and realize , you have to realize that you 're . can they be alive or can it be dead ? no , oh . they would be brought back to life , right ? if they 're dead . yeah , you can bring people back . definitely hitler or stalin . i wan na understand evil . you would need to , oh , to experience what it feel like . i wan na be in their brain feeling what they feel . i might change you forever returning from that . yes , but i think it would also help me understand how to prevent it and fix it . that might be one of those thing , once you experience it , it 'll be a burden to know it . cause you wo n't be able to transfer that . yeah , but a lot of thing are burden . but it 's a useful burden . but it 's a useful burden , yeah . that for sure , i wan na understand evil and psychopathy and that . i have all these fake twitter account where i go into different algorithmic bubble to try to understand . i 'll keep getting in fight with people and realize we 're not actually fighting . i think we used to exist in a monoculture before social medium and stuff . we kinda all got fed the same thing . so we were all speaking the same cultural language . but i think recently , one of the thing that we are n't diagnosing properly enough with social medium is that there 's different dialect . there 's so many different dialect of chinese . there are now becoming different dialect of english . i am realizing there are people who are saying the exact same thing , but they 're using completely different verbiage . and we 're punishing each other for not using the correct verbiage . and we 're completely misunderstanding . people are just misunderstanding what the other people are saying . and i just got in a fight with a friend about anarchism and communism and shit for two hour . and then by the end of a conversation , and then she 'd say something , and i 'm like , but that 's literally what i 'm saying . and she wa like , what ? and then i wa like , fuck , we 've different , i 'm like , our english , the way we are understanding terminology is like drastically , like our algorithm bubble are creating mini dialect . of how language is interpreted , how language is used . that 's so fascinating . and so we 're like having these argument that we do not need to be having . and there 's polarization that 's happening that doe n't need to be happening because we 've got these like algorithmically created dialect occurring . plus on top of that , there 's also different part of the world that speak different language . so there 's literally lost in translation kind of communication . i happen to know the russian language and just know how different it is . then the english language . and i just wonder how much is lost in a little bit of . man , i actually , cause i have a question for you . i have a song coming out tomorrow with i speak who are a russian band . and i speak a little bit of russian and i wa looking at the title and the title in english doe n't match the title in russian . i 'm curious about this . cause look , it say the title in english is last day . and then the title in russian is new day . my pronunciation suck . new day . like what ? like a new day . a new day . yeah , new day , new day . like it 's two different meaning . yeah , new day , yeah . yeah , yeah , new day . new day , but last day . new day . so last day would be the last day . yeah . maybe they . or maybe the title includes both the russian and it 's for . maybe . maybe it 's for bilingual . but to be honest , novodin sound better than just musically . like novodin is new day . that 's the current one . and posledniy den is the last day . i think novodin . i do n't like novodin . but the meaning is so different . that 's kind of awesome actually though . there 's an explicit sort of contrast like that . if everyone on earth disappeared and it wa just you left , what would your day look like ? like what would you do ? everybody 's dead . a far a you . are there corps there ? well seriously , it 's a big . let me think through this . it 's a big difference if there 's just like bird singing versus if there 's like corps littering the street . yeah , there 's corps everywhere , i 'm sorry . it 's , and you do n't actually know what happened and you do n't know why you survived . and you do n't even know if there 's others out there . but it seems clear that it 's all gone . what would you do ? what would i do ? listen , i 'm somebody who really enjoys the moment , enjoys life . i would just go on like enjoying the inanimate object . i would just look for food , basic survival . but most of it is just , listen , when i just , i take walk and i look outside and i 'm just happy that we get to exist on this planet , to be able to breathe air . it 's just all beautiful . it 's full of color , all of this kind of stuff . just , there 's so many thing about life , your own life , conscious life that 's fucking awesome . so i would just enjoy that . but also maybe after a few week , the engineer would start coming out , like wan na build some thing . maybe there 's always hope searching for another human . maybe . probably searching for another human . probably trying to get to a tv or radio station and broadcast something . that 's interesting , i did n't think about that . so like really maximize your ability to connect with others . yeah , like probably try to find another person . would you be excited to see , to meet another person or terrified ? because , you know . i 'd be excited . no matter what . yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . being alone for the last however long of my life would be really bad . that 's the one instance i might , i do n't think i 'd kill myself , but i might kill myself if i had to . so you love people . you love connection to other human . yeah . i kinda hate people too , but yeah . that 's a love hate relationship . yeah . i feel like we 'd have a bunch of weird nietzsche question and stuff though . oh yeah . like i wonder , cause i 'm like , when podcast , i 'm like , is this interesting for people to just have like , or i do n't know , maybe people do like this . when i listen to podcasts , i 'm into like the lore , like the hard lore . like i just love like dan carlin . i 'm like , give me the fact . just like , like the fact into my bloodstream . but you also do n't know , like you 're a fascinating mind to explore . so you do n't realize a you 're talking about stuff , the stuff you 've taken for granted is actually unique and fascinating . the way you think . not always what , like the way you reason through thing is the fascinating thing to listen to . because people kind of see , oh , there 's other human that think differently , that explore thought differently . that 's the cool , that 's also cool . so yeah , dan carlin retelling of history . by the way , his retelling of history is very , i think what 's exciting is not the history , is his way of thinking about history . no , i think dan carlin is one of the people , like when , dan carlin is one of the people that really started getting me excited about like revolutionizing education . because like dan carlin instilled , i already like really liked history , but he instilled like an obsessive love of history in me to the point where like now i 'm fucking reading , like going to bed , reading like part four of the rise and fall of the third reich or whatever . like i got like dense as history , but like he like opened that door that like made me want to be a scholar of that topic . like it 's like , i feel like he 's such a good teacher . he just like , you know , and it sort of made me feel like one of the thing we could do with education is like find like the world 's great , the teacher that like create passion for the topic because autodidactricism , i do n't know how to say that properly , but like self teaching is like much faster than being lectured to . like it 's much more efficient to sort of like be able to teach yourself and then ask a teacher question when you do n't know what 's up . but like , you know , that 's why it 's like in university and stuff , like you can learn so much more material so much faster because you 're doing a lot of the learning on your own and you 're going to the teacher for when you get stuck . but like these teacher that can inspire passion for a topic , i think that is one of the most invaluable skill in our whole specie . like , because if you can do that , then you , it 's like ai , like ai is going to teach itself so much more efficiently than we can teach it . we just needed to get it to the point where it can teach itself . and then . it find the motivation to do so , right ? yeah . so like you inspire it to do so . yeah . and then it could teach itself . what do you make of the fact , you mentioned rise and fall of the third reich . i just . have you read that ? yeah , i read it twice . you read it twice ? yes . okay , so no one even know what it is . yeah . and i 'm like , wait , i thought this wa like a super poppin book . super pop . yeah , i 'm not like that , i 'm not that far in it . but it is , it 's so interesting . yeah , it 's written by a person that wa there , which is very important to kind of . you know , you start being like , how could this possibly happen ? and then when you read rise and fall of the third reich , it 's like , people tried really hard for this to not happen . people tried , they almost reinstated a monarchy at one point to try to stop this from happening . like they almost like abandoned democracy to try to get this to not happen . at least the way it make me feel is that there 's a bunch of small moment on which history can turn . yes . it 's like small meeting . yes . human interaction . and it 's both terrifying and inspiring because it 's like , even just attempt at assassinating hitler , like time and time again failed . and they were so close . wa it like operation valkyrie ? such a good . and then there 's also the role of , that 's a really heavy burden , which is from a geopolitical perspective , the role of leader to see evil before it truly becomes evil , to anticipate it , to stand up to evil . because evil is actually pretty rare in this world at a scale that hitler wa . we tend to , you know , in the modern discourse kind of call people evil too quickly . if you look at ancient history , like there wa a ton of hitler . i actually think it 's more the norm than , like again , going back to like my sort of intelligent design theory , i think one of the thing we 've been successfully doing in our slow move from survival of the fittest to intelligent design is we 've kind of been eradicating , like if you look at like ancient assyria and stuff , like that shit wa like brutal and just like the head on the , like brutal , like genghis khan just like genocide after genocide wa like throwing plague body over the wall and decimating whole city or like the muslim conquest of like damascus and shit . just like people , city used to get leveled all the fucking time . okay , get into the bronze age collapse . it 's basically , there wa like almost like roman level like society . like there wa like all over the world , like global trade , like everything wa awesome through a mix of , i think a bit of climate change and then the development of iron because basically bronze could only come from this , the way to make bronze , like everything had to be funneled through this one iranian mine . and so it 's like , there wa just this one supply chain and this is one of the thing that make me worried about supply chain and why i think we need to be so thoughtful about , i think our biggest issue with society right now , like the thing that is most likely to go wrong is probably supply chain collapse , because war , climate change , whatever , like anything that cause supply chain collapse , our population is too big to handle that . and like the thing that seems to cause dark age is mass supply chain collapse . but the bronze age collapse happened like , it wa sort of like this ancient collapse that happened where like literally like ancient egypt , all these city , everything just got like decimated , destroyed , abandoned city , like hundred of them . there wa like a flourishing society , like we were almost coming to modernity and everything got leveled . and they had this mini dark age , but it wa just like , there 's so little writing or recording from that time that like , there is n't a lot of information about the bronze age collapse , but it wa basically equivalent to like medieval , the medieval dark age . but it just happened , i do n't know the year , but like thousand of year earlier . and then we sort of like recovered from the bronze age collapse , empire reemerged , writing and trade and everything reemerged . and then we of course had the more contemporary dark age . and then over time , we 've designed mechanism to lessen and lessen the capability for the destructive power center to emerge . there 's more recording about the more contemporary dark age . so i think we have like a better understanding of how to avoid it , but i still think we 're at high risk for it . i think that 's one of the big risk right now . so the natural state of being for human is for there to be a lot of hitler , which ha gotten really good at making it hard for them to emerge . we 've gotten better at collaboration and resisting the power , like authoritarian to come to power . we 're trying to go country by country , like we 're moving past this . we 're kind of like slowly incrementally , like moving towards like not scary old school war stuff . and i think seeing it happen in some of the country that at least nominally are like supposed to have moved past that , that 's scary because it reminds u that it can happen like in the place that have moved supposedly , a hopefully moved past that . and possibly at a civilization level , like you said , supply chain collapse might make people resource constraint , might make people desperate , angry , hateful , violent , and drag u right back in . i mean , supply chain collapse is how , like the ultimate thing that caused the middle age wa supply chain collapse . it 's like people , because people were reliant on a certain level of technology , like people , like you look at like britain , like they had glass , like people had aqueduct , people had like indoor heating and cooling and like running water and like buy food from all over the world and trade and market . like people did n't know how to hunt and forage and gather . and so we 're in a similar situation . we are not educated enough to survive without technology . so if we have a supply chain collapse that like limit our access to technology , there will be like massive starvation and violence and displacement and war . like , you know , it 's like , yeah . in my opinion , it 's like the primary marker of like what a dark age is . well , technology is kind of enabling u to be more resilient in term of supply chain , in term of , to all the different catastrophic event that happened to u . although the pandemic ha kind of challenged our preparedness for the catastrophic . what do you think is the coolest invention human come up with ? the wheel , fire , cooking meat . computer . computer . freaking computer . internet or computer ? which one ? what do you think the ? previous technology , i mean , may have even been more profound and moved u to a certain degree , but i think the computer are what make u homo tech now . i think this is what , it 's a brain augmentation . and so it like allows for actual evolution . like the computer accelerate the degree to which all the other technology can also be accelerated . would you classify yourself a a homo sapien or a homo techno ? definitely homo techno . so you 're one of the earliest of the specie . i think most of u are . like , a i said , like , i think if you like looked at brain scan of u versus human a hundred year ago , it would look very different . i think we are physiologically different . just even the interaction with the device ha changed our brain . well , and if you look at , a lot of study are coming out to show that like , there 's a degree of inherited memory . so some of these physiological change in theory should be , we should be passing them on . so like that 's , you know , that 's not like a , an instance of physiological change that 's gon na fizzle out . in theory , that should progress like to our offspring . speaking of offspring , what advice would you give to a young person , like in high school , whether there be an artist , a creative , an engineer , any kind of career path , or maybe just life in general , how they can live a life they can be proud of ? i think one of my big thought , and like , especially now having kid , is that i do n't think we spend enough time teaching creativity . and i think creativity is a muscle like other thing . and there 's a lot of emphasis on , you know , learn how to play the piano . and then you can write a song or like learn the technical stuff . and then you can do a thing . but i think it 's , like , i have a friend who 's like world 's greatest guitar player , like , you know , amazing sort of like producer , work with other people , but he 's really sort of like , you know , he like engineer and record thing and like doe solo , but he doe n't really like make his own music . and i wa talking to him and i wa like , dude , you 're so talented at music . like , why do n't you make music or whatever ? and he wa like , cause i got , i 'm too old . i never learned the creative muscle . and it 's like , you know , it 's embarrassing . it 's like learning the creative muscle take a lot of failure . and it also sort of , if when you 're being creative , you know , you 're throwing paint at a wall and a lot of stuff will fail . so like part of it is like a tolerance for failure and humiliation . and that 's somehow that 's easier to develop when you 're young or be persist through it when you 're young . everything is easier to develop when you 're young . yes . and the younger , the better . it could destroy you . i mean , that 's the shitty thing about creativity . if , you know , failure could destroy you if you 're not careful , but that 's a risk worth taking . but also , but at a young age , developing a tolerance to failure is good . i fail all the time . like i do stupid shit all the time . like in public , in private , i get canceled for , i 've make all kind of mistake , but i just like am very resilient about making mistake . and so then like i do a lot of thing that like other people would n't do . and like , i think my greatest asset is my creativity . and i like , i think pain , like tolerance to failure is just a super essential thing that should be taught before other thing . brilliant advice . yeah , yeah . i wish everybody encouraged sort of failure more a opposed to kind of . cause we like punish failure . we 're like , no , like when we were teaching kid , we 're like , no , that 's wrong . like that 's , you know , like x keep like will be like wrong . at the , because i , you know , when i met him , i came in all furious about spotify and like i grilled him super hard . so i 've got his answer here . but he wa saying like at the sort of peak of the cd industry , there wa like 20,000 artist making million and million of dollar . like there wa just like a very tiny kind of 1 % . and spotify ha kind of democratized the industry because now i think he said there 's about a million artist making a good living from spotify . and when i heard that , i wa like , honestly , i would rather make le money and have just like a decent living and have more artist be able to have that , even though i like , i wish it could include everyone , but . yeah , that 's really hard to argue with . youtube is the same . it 's youtube 's mission . they want to basically have a many creator a possible and make a living , some kind of living . and that 's so hard to argue with . it 's so hard . but i think there 's better way to do it . my manager , i actually wish he wa here . like i would have brought him up . my manager is building an app that can manage you . so it 'll like help you organize your percentage and get your publishing and dah , dah , dah , dah , dah . so you can take out all the middleman so you can have a much bigger , it 'll just like automate it . so you can get . so automate the manager ? automate management , publishing , and legal , it can read , the app he 's building can read your contract and like tell you about it . because one of the issue with music right now , it 's not that we 're not getting paid enough , but it 's that the art industry is filled with middleman because artist are not good at business . and from the beginning , like frank sinatra , it 's all mob stuff . like it 's the music industry is run by business people , not the artist and the artist really get very small cut of like what they make . and so i think part of the reason i 'm a technocrat , which i mean , your fan are gon na be technocrat . so no one 's , they 're not gon na be mad at me about this , but like my fan hate it when i say this kind of thing or the general public . they do n't like technocrat . they do n't like technocrat . like when i watched battle angel alita and they were like the martian technocracy and i wa like , yeah , martian technocracy . and then they were like , and they 're evil . and i wa like , oh , okay . i wa like , cause martian technocracy sound sick to me . yeah , so your intuition a technocrat would create some kind of beautiful world . for example , what my manager 's working on , if you can create an app that remove the need for a lawyer and then you could have smart contract on the blockchain , remove the need for like management and organizing all this stuff , like can read your stuff and explain it to you , can collect your royalty , you know , like then the small amount , the amount of money that you 're getting from spotify actually mean a lot more and go a lot farther . it can remove some of the bureaucracy , some of the inefficiency that make life not a great a it could be . yeah , i think the issue is n't that there 's not enough . like the issue is that there 's inefficiency and i 'm really into this positive sum mindset , you know , the win , win mindset of like , instead of , you know , fighting over the scrap , how do we make the , or worrying about scarcity , like instead of a scarcity mindset , why do n't we just increase the efficiency and , you know , in that way . expand the size of the pie . let me ask you about experimentation . so you said , which is beautiful , being a musician is like having a conversation with all those that came before you . how much of creating music is like kind of having that conversation , trying to fit into the cultural trend and how much of it is like trying to , a much a possible , be an outsider and come up with something totally new . it 's like when you 're thinking , when you 're experimenting , are you trying to be totally different , totally weird ? are you trying to fit in ? man , this is so hard because i feel like i 'm kind of in the process of semi retiring from music , so this is like my old brain . yeah , bring it from like the shelf , put it on the table for a couple minute , we 'll just poke it . i think it 's a bit of both because i think forcing yourself to engage with new music is really great for neuroplasticity . like i think , you know , a people , part of the reason music is marketed at young people is because young people are very neuroplastic . so like if you 're 16 to like 23 or whatever , it 's gon na be really easy for you to love new music . and if you 're older than that , it get harder and harder and harder . and i think one of the beautiful thing about being a musician is i just constantly force myself to listen to new music and i think it keep my brain really plastic . and i think this is a really good exercise . i just think everyone should do this . you listen to new music and you hate it , i think you should just keep , force yourself to like , okay , well why do people like it ? and like , you know , make your brain form new neural pathway and be more open to change . that 's really brilliant actually . sorry to interrupt , but like that exercise is really amazing to sort of embrace change , embrace sort of practice neuroplasticity . because like that 's one of the thing , you fall in love with a certain band and you just kind of stay with that for the rest of your life and then you never understand the modern music . that 's a really good exercise . most of the streaming on spotify is like classic rock and stuff . like new music make up a very small chunk of what is played on spotify . and i think this is like not a good sign for u a a specie . i think , yeah . so it 's a good measure of the specie open mindedness to change is how often you listen to new music . the brain , let 's put the music brain back on the shelf . i got ta pull out the futurist brain for a second . in what wild way do you think the future , say in like 30 year , maybe 50 year , maybe a hundred year will be different from our current way of life on earth ? we can talk about augmented reality , virtual reality , maybe robot , maybe space travel , maybe video game , maybe genetic engineering . i can keep going . cyborg , alien , world war , maybe destructive nuclear war , good and bad . when you think about the future , what are you imagining ? what 's the weirdest and the wildest it could be ? have you read surface detail by iain bank ? surface detail is my favorite depiction of a , oh wow , you have to read this book . it 's literally the greatest science fiction book possibly ever written . iain bank is the man , yeah , for sure . what have you read ? just the player of game . i read that title ca n't be copyrighted so you can just steal them . and i wa like , player of game , sick . nice . yeah , so you can name your album . like i always wanted to . romeo and juliet or something . i always wanted to name an album war and peace . nice . like that would be , like you . that is a good , that 's a good , where have i heard that before ? you can do that , like you could do that . also thing that are in the public domain . for people who have no clue , you do have a song called player of game . yes , oh yeah . so iain bank , surface detail is in my opinion the best future that i 've ever read about or heard about in science fiction . basically there 's the relationship with super intelligence , like artificial super intelligence is just , it 's like great . i want to credit the person who coined this term because i love this term . and i feel like young woman do n't get enough credit in . yeah , so if you go to protopia future on instagram , what is her name ? personalized donor experience at scale , our ai power donor experience . monica bealskite , i 'm saying that wrong . and i 'm probably gon na , i 'm probably butchering this a bit , but protopia is sort of , if utopia is unattainable , protopia is sort of like , you know . wow , that 's an awesome instagram , protopia future . a great , a future that is , you know , a good a we can get . the future , positive future . ai , is this a centralized ai in surface detail or is it distributed ? what kind of ai is it ? they mostly exist a giant super ship , like sort of like the guild ship in dune . like they 're these giant ship that kind of move people around and the ship are sentient and they can talk to all the passenger . and i mean , there 's a lot of different type of ai in the banksyan future , but in the opening scene of surface detail , there 's this place called the culture and the culture is basically a protopian future . and a protopian future , i think , is like a future that is like , obviously it 's not utopia , it 's not perfect . and like , cause like striving for utopia , i think feel hopeless and it 's sort of like , maybe not the best terminology to be using . so it 's like , it 's a pretty good place . like mostly like , you know , super intelligence and biological being exist fairly in harmony . there 's not too much war . there 's like a close to equality a you can get , you know , it 's like approximately a good future . like there 's really awesome stuff . it 's , and in the opening scene , this girl , she 's born a a sex slave outside of the culture . so she 's in a society that doe n't adhere to the cultural value . she try to kill the guy who is her like master , but he kill her , but unbeknownst to her , when she wa traveling on a ship through the culture like he 'll say like crazy thing . like x keep being like , like bubble car , bubble car . and i 'm like , and you know , i 'm like , what 's a bubble car ? like , but like , it doe n't like , but i do n't want to be like , no , you 're wrong . i 'm like , you 're thinking of weird , crazy shit . like , i do n't know what a bubble car is , but like . it 's creating world and they might be internally consistent . and through that , you might discover something fundamental about this world . yeah , or he 'll like rewrite song , like with word that he prefers . so like , instead of baby shark , he say baby car . it 's like . maybe he 's onto something . let me ask the big , ridiculous question . we were kind of dancing around it , but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing we have here of human civilization , of life on earth , but in general , just life ? what 's the meaning of life ? c. have you , did you read nova scene yet ? by james lovelock ? you 're doing a lot of really good book recommendation here . i have n't even finished this , so i 'm a huge fraud yet again . but like really early in the book , he say this amazing thing . like , i feel like everyone 's so sad and cynical . like everyone 's like the fermi paradox and everyone . i just keep hearing people being like , fuck , what if we 're alone ? like , oh no , ah , like , ah , ah . and i 'm like , okay , but like , wait , what if this is the beginning ? like in nova scene , he say , this is not gon na be a correct , i ca n't like memorize quote , but he say something like , what if our consciousness , like right now , like this is the universe waking up ? like what if instead of discovering the universe , this is the universe , like this is the evolution of the literal universe herself . like we are not separate from the universe . like this is the universe waking up . this is the universe seeing herself for the first time . like this is . the universe becoming conscious . the first time we were a part of that . yeah , cause it 's like , we are n't separate from the universe . like this could be like an incredibly sacred moment and maybe like social medium and all this thing , the stuff where we 're all getting connected together . like maybe these are the neuron connecting of the like collective super intelligence that is , waking up . the , yeah , like , you know , it 's like , maybe instead of something cynical or maybe if there 's something to discover , like maybe this is just , you know , we 're a blast assist of like some incredible kind of consciousness or being . and just like in the first three year of life or for human child , we 'll forget about all the suffering that we 're going through now . i think we 'll probably forget about this . i mean , probably , you know , artificial intelligence will eventually render u obsolete . i do n't think they 'll do it in a malicious way , but i think probably we are very weak . the sun is expanding . like , i do n't know , like , hopefully we can get to mar , but like , we 're pretty vulnerable . and i , you know , like , i think we can coexist for a long time with ai and we can also probably make ourselves le vulnerable , but , you know , i just think consciousness , sentience , self awareness , like , i think this might be the single greatest like moment in evolution ever . and like , maybe this is , you know , the big , like the true beginning of life . and we 're just , we 're the blue green algae or we 're like the single celled organism of something amazing . the universe awakens and this is it . yeah . well , see , you 're an incredible person . you 're a fascinating mind . you should definitely do , your friend liv mentioned that you guy were thinking of maybe talking . i would love it if you explored your mind in this kind of medium more and more by doing a podcast with her or just in any kind of way . so you 're an awesome person . it 's an honor to know you . it 's an honor to get to sit down with you late at night , which is like surreal . and i really enjoyed it . thank you for talking today . yeah , no , i mean , huge honor . i feel very underqualified to be here , but i 'm a big fan . i 've been listening to the podcast a lot and yeah , me and liv would appreciate any advice and help and we 're definitely gon na do that . so yeah . anytime . thank you . cool , thank you . thanks for listening to this conversation with grime . to support this podcast , please check out our sponsor in the description . and now let me leave you with some word from oscar wilde . yes , i 'm a dreamer . for a dreamer is one who can only find her way by moonlight and her punishment is that she see the dawn before the rest of the world . thank you for listening and hope to see you next time . with him one day , a ship put a neural lace in her head and neural lace is sort of like , it 's basically a neuralink because life imitates art . it doe indeed . it doe indeed . so she wake up and the opening scene is her memory ha been uploaded by this neural lace when she ha been killed . and now she get to choose a new body . and this ai is interfacing with her recorded memory in her neural lace and helping her and being like , hello , you 're dead . but because you had a neural lace , your memory 's uploaded . do you want to choose a new body ? and you 're going to be born here in the culture and like start a new life , which is just , that 's like the opening . it 's like so sick . and the ship is the super intelligence . all the ship are kind of super intelligence . but they still want to preserve a kind of rich , fulfilling experience for the human . yeah , like they 're like friend with the human . and then there 's a bunch of ship that do n't want to exist with biological being , but they just have their own place like way over there . but they do n't , they just do their own thing . they 're not necessarily . so it 's a pretty , this protopian existence is pretty peaceful . yeah , i mean , and then , for example , one of the main fight in the book is they 're fighting , there 's these artificial hell that , and people do n't think it 's ethical to have artificial hell . like basically when people do crime , they get sent , like when they die , their memory get sent to an artificial hell and they 're eternally tortured . and so , and then the way that society is deciding whether or not to have the artificial hell is that they 're having these simulated , they 're having like a simulated war . so instead of actual blood , you know , people are basically essentially fighting in a video game to choose the outcome of this . but they 're still experiencing the suffering in this artificial hell or no ? can you experience stuff or ? so the artificial hell suck . and a lot of people in the culture want to get rid of the artificial hell . there 's a simulated war , are they happening in the artificial hell ? so no , the simulated war are happening outside of the artificial hell , between the political faction who are , so this political faction say we should have simulated hell to deter crime . and this political faction is saying , no , simulated hell is unethical . and so instead of like having , you know , blowing each other up with nuke , they 're having like a giant fortnite battle to decide this , which , you know , to me that 's protopia . that 's like , okay , we can have war without death . you know , i do n't think there should be simulated hell . i think that is definitely one of the way in which technology could go very , very , very , very wrong . so almost punishing people in a digital space or something like that . yeah , like torturing people 's memory . so either a a deterrent , like if you committed a crime , but also just for personal pleasure , if there 's some sick , demented human in this world . dan carlin actually ha this episode of hardcore history on painful attainment . oh , that episode is fucked . it 's dark , because he kind of go through human history and say like , we a human seem to enjoy , secretly enjoy or used to be openly enjoy sort of the torture and the death , watching the death and torture of other human . i do think if people were consenting , we should be allowed to have gladiatorial match . but consent is hard to achieve in those situation . it always start getting slippery . like it could be also forced consent , like it start getting weird . there 's way too much excitement . like this is what he highlight . there 's something about human nature that want to see that violence . and it 's really dark . and you hope that we can sort of overcome that aspect of human nature , but that 's still within u somewhere . well , i think that 's what we 're doing right now . i have this theory that what is very important about the current moment is that all of evolution ha been survival of the fittest up until now . and at some point , the line are kind of fuzzy , but in the recent past , or maybe even just right now , we 're getting to this point where we can choose intelligent design . like we probably since like the integration of the iphone , like we are becoming cyborg . like our brain are fundamentally changed . everyone who grew up with electronics , we are fundamentally different from previous , from homo sapiens . i call u homo techno . i think we have evolved into homo techno , which is like essentially a new specie . like if you look at the way , if you took an mri of my brain and you took an mri of like a medieval brain , i think it would be very different the way that it ha evolved . do you think when historian look back at this time , they 'll see like this wa a fundamental shift to what a human being is ? i think , i do not think we are still homo sapiens . i believe we are homo techno . and i think we have evolved . and i think right now , the way we are evolving , we can choose how we do that . and i think we are being very reckless about how we 're doing that . like we 're just having social medium , but i think this idea that like this is a time to choose intelligent design should be taken very seriously . it like now is the moment to reprogram the human computer . it 's like , if you go blind , your visual cortex will get taken over with other function . we can choose our own evolution . we can change the way our brain work . and so we actually have a huge responsibility to do that . and i think i 'm not sure who should be responsible for that , but there 's definitely not adequate education . we 're being inundated with all this technology that is fundamentally changing the physical structure of our brain . and we are not adequately responding to that to choose how we wan na evolve . and we could evolve , we could be really whatever we want . and i think this is a really important time . and i think if we choose correctly and we choose wisely , consciousness could exist for a very long time and integration with ai could be extremely positive . and i do n't think enough people are focusing on this specific situation . do you think we might irreversibly screw thing up if we get thing wrong now ? because the flip side of that , it seems human are pretty adaptive . so maybe the way we figure thing out is by screwing it up , like social medium . over a generation , we 'll see the negative effect of social medium , and then we build new social medias , and we just keep improving stuff . and then we learn from the failure of the past . because human seem to be really adaptive . on the flip side , we can get it wrong in a way where literally we create weapon of war or increase hate . past a certain threshold , we really do a lot of damage . i mean , i think we 're optimized to notice the negative thing . but i would actually say one of the thing that i think people are n't noticing is if you look at silicon valley and you look at the technocracy , like what 's been happening there . when silicon valley started , it wa all just facebook and all this for profit crap that really wa n't particular . i guess it wa useful , but it 's sort of just whatever . but now you see lab grown meat , compostable , or biodegradable , single use cutlery , or meditation apps . i think we are actually evolving and changing , and technology is changing . i think there just maybe there is n't quite enough education about this . and also , i do n't know if there 's quite enough incentive for it because i think the way capitalism work , what we define a profit , we 're also working on an old model of what we define a profit . i really think if we changed the idea of profit to include social good , you can have economic profit , social good also counting a profit would incentivize thing that are more useful and more whatever spiritual technology or positive technology or thing that help reprogram a human computer in a good way or thing that help u intelligently design our new brain . yeah , there 's no reason why within the framework of capitalism , the word profit or the idea of profit ca n't also incorporate the well being of a human being . so like long term well being , long term happiness . or even for example , we were talking about motherhood , like part of the reason i 'm so late is because i had to get the baby to bed . and it 's like , i keep thinking about motherhood , how under capitalism , it 's like this extremely essential job that is very difficult that is not compensated . and we sort of like value thing by how much we compensate them . and so we really devalue motherhood in our society and pretty much all society . like capitalism doe not recognize motherhood . it 's just a job that you 're supposed to do for free . and it 's like , but i feel like producing great human should be seen a a great , a profit under capitalism . like that should be , that 's like a huge social good . like every awesome human that get made add so much to the world . so like if that wa integrated into the profit structure , then , you know , and if we potentially found a way to compensate motherhood . so come up with a compensation that 's much broader than just money or . or it could just be money . like , what if you just made , i do n't know , but i do n't know how you 'd pay for that . like , i mean , that 's where you start getting into . reallocation of resource that people get upset over . well , like what if we made like a motherhood dow ? yeah , yeah . and , you know , used it to fund like single mother , like , you know , pay for making baby . so , i mean , if you create and put beautiful thing onto the world , that could be company , that can be bridge , that could be art , that could be a lot of thing , and that could be child , which are . or education or . anything , that should be valued by society , and that should be somehow incorporated into the framework of what , a a market , of what . like , if you contribute child to this world , that should be valued and respected and sort of celebrated , like , proportional to what it is , which is , it 's the thing that fuel human civilization . yeah , like i . it 's kind of important . i feel like everyone 's always saying , i mean , i think we 're in very different social sphere , but everyone 's always saying , like , dismantle capitalism . and i 'm like , well , okay , well , i do n't think the government should own everything . like , i do n't think we should not have private ownership . like , that 's scary . you know , like that start getting into weird stuff and just sort of like , i feel there 's almost no way to do that without a police state , you know ? but obviously , capitalism ha some major flaw . and i think actually mac showed me this idea called social capitalism , which is a form of capitalism that just like considers social good to be also profit . like , you know , it 's like , right now company need to , like , you 're supposed to grow every quarter or whatever to like show that you 're functioning well , but it 's like , okay , well , what if you kept the same amount of profit ? you 're still in the green , but then you have also all this social good . like , do you really need all this extra economic growth or could you add this social good and that count ? and , you know , i do n't know if , i am not an economist . i have no idea how this could be achieved , but . i do n't think economist know how anything could be achieved either , but they pretend . it 's the thing , they construct a model and they go on tv show and sound like an expert . that 's the definition of economist . how did being a mother , becoming a mother change you a a human being , would you say ? man , i think it kind of changed everything and it 's still changing me a lot . it 's actually changing me more right now in this moment than it wa before . like today , like this ? just like in the most recent month and stuff . can you elucidate that , how change , like when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself , it 's again , which , who are you ? how have you become different , would you say ? i think it 's just really reorienting my priority . and at first i wa really fighting against that because i somehow felt it wa like a failure of feminism or something . like i felt like it wa like bad if like my kid started mattering more than my work . and then like more recently i started sort of analyzing that thought in myself and being like , that 's also kind of a construct . it 's like , we 've just devalued motherhood so much in our culture that like , i feel guilty for caring about my kid more than i care about my work . so feminism includes breaking out of whatever the construct is . so just continually breaking , it 's like freedom empower you to be free . and that mean ... but it also , but like being a mother , like i 'm so much more creative . like i can not believe the massive amount of brain growth that i am . why do you think that is ? just cause like the stake are higher somehow ? i think it 's like , it 's just so trippy watching consciousness emerge . it 's just like , it 's like going on a crazy journey or something . it 's like the craziest science fiction novel you could ever read . it 's just so crazy watching consciousness come into being . and then at the same time , like you 're forced to value your time so much . like when i have creative time now , it 's so sacred . i need to like be really fricking on it . but the other thing is that i used to just be like a cynic and i used to just wan na ... like my last album wa called miss anthropocene and it wa like this like , it wa like a study in villainy or like it wa like , well , what if we have , instead of the old god , we have like new god and it 's like miss anthropocene is like misanthrope like and anthropocene , which is like the , you know , like and she 's the goddess of climate change or whatever . and she 's like destroying the world . and it wa just like , it wa like dark and it wa like a study in villainy . and it wa sort of just like , like i used to like have no problem just making cynical , angry , scary art . and not that there 's anything wrong with that , but i think having kid just make you such an optimist . it just inherently make you wan na be an optimist so bad that like i feel more responsibility to make more optimistic thing . and i get a lot of shit for it because everyone 's like , oh , you 're so privileged . stop talking about like pie in the sky , stupid concept and focus on like the now . but it 's like , i think if we do n't ideate about future that could be good , we wo n't be able to get them . if everything is blade runner , then we 're gon na end up with blade runner . it 's like , a we said earlier , life imitates art . like life really doe imitate art . and so we really need more protopian or utopian art . i think this is incredibly essential for the future of humanity . and i think the current discourse where that 's seen a a thinking about protopia or utopia is seen a a dismissal of the problem that we currently have . i think that is an incorrect mindset . and like having kid just make me wan na imagine amazing future that like maybe i wo n't be able to build , but they will be able to build if they want to . yeah , it doe seem like ideation is a precursor to creation . so you have to imagine it in order to be able to build it . and there is a sad thing about human nature that somehow a cynical view of the world is seen a a insightful view . you know , cynicism is often confused for insight , which is sad to see . and optimism is confused for naivete . yes , yes . like you do n't , you 're blinded by your , maybe your privilege or whatever . you 're blinded by something , but you 're certainly blinded . that 's sad , that 's sad to see because it seems like the optimist are the one that create our future . they 're the one that build . in order to build the crazy thing , you have to be optimistic . you have to be either stupid or excited or passionate or mad enough to actually believe that it can be built . and those are the people that built it . my favorite quote of all time is from star war , episode 8 , which i know everyone hate . do you like star war , episode 8 ? no , yeah , probably i would say i would probably hate it , yeah . i do n't have strong feeling about it . let me backtrack . i do n't have strong feeling about star war . i 'm a tolkien person . i 'm more into dragon and orcs and ogre . yeah , i mean , tolkien forever . i really want to have one more son and call him , i thought tao tecno tolkien would be cool . it 's a lot of t 's , i like it . yeah , and well , and tao is six , two , eight , two pi . yeah , tao tecno , yeah , yeah , yeah . and then techno is obviously the best genre of music , but also like technocracy . it just sound really good . yeah , that 's right , and techno tolkien , tao tecno tolkien . that 's a good , that 's it . tao tecno tolkien , but star war , episode 8 , i know a lot of people have issue with it . personally , on the record , i think it 's the best star war film . you 're starting trouble today . yeah , but do n't kill what you hate , save what you love . do n't kill what you hate . do n't kill what you hate , save what you love . and i think we 're , in society right now , we 're in a diagnosis mode . we 're just diagnosing and diagnosing and diagnosing , and we 're trying to kill what we hate , and we 're not trying to save what we love enough . and there 's this buckminster fuller quote , which i 'm gon na butcher , because i do n't remember it correctly , but it 's something along the line of , do n't try to destroy the old bad model , render them obsolete with better model . maybe we do n't need to destroy the oil industry . maybe we just create a great new battery technology and sustainable transport , and just make it economically unreasonable to still continue to rely on fossil fuel . it 's like , do n't kill what you hate , save what you love . make new thing and just render the old thing unusable . it 's like if the college debt is so bad , and university are so expensive , and i feel like education is becoming obsolete . i feel like we could completely revolutionize education , and we could make it free . and it 's like , you look at jstor , and you have to pay to get all the study and everything . what if we created a dao that bought jstor , or we created a dao that wa funding study , and those study were open source , or free for everyone . and what if we just open sourced education and decentralized education and made it free , and all research wa on the internet , and all the outcome of study were on the internet , and no one ha student debt , and you just take test when you apply for a job , and if you 're qualified , then you can work there . this is just like , i do n't know how anything work . i 'm just randomly ranting , but . i like the humility . you got ta think from just basic first principle . what is the problem ? what 's broken ? what are some idea ? that 's it . and get excited about those idea , and share your excitement , and do n't tear each other down . it 's just when you kill thing , you often end up killing yourself . like war is not a one sided , like you 're not gon na go in and just kill them , like you 're gon na get stabbed . it 's like , and i think when i talk about this nexus point of that we 're in this point in society where we 're switching to intelligent design , i think part of our switch to intelligent design is that we need to choose nonviolence . and we need to , like , i think we can choose to start , i do n't think we can eradicate violence from our specie , because i think we need it a little bit , but i think we can choose to really reorient our primitive brain that are fighting over scarcity , and that are so attack oriented , and move into , we can optimize for creativity and building . yeah , it 's interesting to think how that happens , so some of it is just education , some of it is living life and introspecting your own mind , and trying to live up to the better angel of your nature for each one of u , all those kind of thing at scale . that 's how we can sort of start to minimize the amount of destructive war in our world , and that 's , to me , probably you 're the same , technology is a really promising way to do that . like , social medium should be a really promising way to do that , it 's a way we connect . i , you know , for the most part , i really enjoy social medium . i just know all the negative stuff . i do n't engage with any of the negative stuff . just not even , like , by blocking or any of that kind of stuff , but just not letting it enter my mind . like , just , like , when somebody say something negative , i see it , i immediately think positive thought about them , and i just forget they exist after that . just move on , because , like , that negative energy , if i return the negative energy , they 're going to get excited in a negative way right back , and it 's just this kind of vicious cycle . but you would think technology would assist u in this process of letting go , of not taking thing personally , of not engaging in the negativity , but unfortunately , social medium profit from the negativity , so the current model . i mean , social medium is like a gun . like , you should take a course before you use it . like , it 's like , this is what i mean , like , when i say reprogram the human computer . like , in school , you should learn about how social medium optimizes to , you know , raise your cortisol level and make you angry and crazy and stressed , and , like , you should learn how to have hygiene about how you use social medium . but , so you can , yeah , choose not to focus on the negative stuff , but i do n't know . i 'm not sure social medium should , i guess it should exist . i 'm not sure . i mean , we 're in the messy , it 's the experimental phase . like , we 're working it out . yeah , it 's the early day . i do n't even know , when you say social medium , i do n't know what that even mean . we 're in the very early day . i think social medium is just basic human connection in the digital realm , and that , i think it should exist , but there 's so many way to do it in a bad way . there 's so many way to do it in a good way . there 's all discussion of all the same human right . we talk about freedom of speech . we talk about sort of violence in the space of digital medium . we talk about hate speech . we talk about all these thing that we had to figure out back in the day in the physical space . we 're now figuring out in the digital space , and it 's like baby stage . when the printing press came out , it wa like pure chaos for a minute , you know ? it 's like when you inject , when there 's a massive information injection into the general population , there 's just gon na be , i feel like the printing press , i do n't have the year , but it wa like printing press came out , shit got really fucking bad for a minute , but then we got the enlightenment . and so it 's like , i think we 're in , this is like the second coming of the printing press . we 're probably gon na have some shitty time for a minute , and then we 're gon na have recalibrate to have a better understanding of how we consume medium and how we deliver medium . speaking of programming the human computer , you mentioned baby x . so there 's this young consciousness coming to be , came from a cell . like that whole thing doe n't even make sense . it came from dna . yeah . and then there 's this baby computer that just like grows and grows and grows and grows , and now there 's a conscious being with extremely impressive cognitive capability with , have you met him ? yes , yeah . yeah . he 's actually really smart . he 's really smart . yeah . he 's weird . yeah . or a baby . he doe . i do n't , i have n't . i do n't know a lot of other baby , but he seems to be smart . zach , i do n't hang out with baby often , but this baby wa very impressive . he doe a lot of prank and stuff . oh , so he 's like . like he 'll like give you a treat and then take it away and laugh and like stuff like that . so he 's like a chess player . so here 's a cognitive sort of , there 's a computer being programmed . so he 's taking in the environment , interacting with a specific set of human . how would you , first of all , what is it ? what , let me ask . i want to ask how do you program this computer ? and also how do you make sense of that there 's a conscious being right there that wa n't there before ? it 's giving me a lot of crisis thought . i 'm thinking really hard . i think that 's part of the reason it 's like , i 'm struggling to focus on art and stuff right now . cause baby x is becoming conscious and like my it 's just reorienting my brain . like my brain is suddenly totally shifting of like , oh shit , like the way we raise child . like , i hate all the baby book and everything . i hate them . like they 're , oh , the art is so bad . and like all this stuff , everything about all the aesthetic . and like , i 'm just like , ah , like this is so . the programming language we 're using to program these baby computer is n't good . yeah , like i 'm thinking , and i , not that i have like good answer or know what to do , but i 'm just thinking really , really hard about it . i , we recently watched totoro with him , studio ghibli . and it 's just like a fantastic film . and he like responded to , i know you 're not supposed to show baby screen too much , but like , i think it 's the most sort of like , i feel like it 's the highest art baby content . like it really speaks , there 's almost no talking in it . it 's really simple . although all the dialogue is super , super , super simple , you know , and it 's like a one to three year old can like really connect with it . like it feel like it 's almost aimed at like a one to three year old , but it 's like great art and it 's so imaginative and it 's so beautiful . and like the first time i showed it to him , he wa just like so invested in it , unlike i 've ever , unlike anything else i 'd ever shown him . like he wa just like cry when they cry and laughing when they laugh , like just like having this roller coaster of like emotion , like , and he learned a bunch of word . like he wa , and he started saying totoro and started just saying all this stuff after watching totoro , and he want to watch it all the time . and i wa like , man , why is n't there an industry of this ? like why are n't our best artist focusing on making art like for the birth of consciousness ? like , and that 's one of the thing i 've been thinking i really wan na start doing . you know , i do n't wan na speak before i do thing too much , but like , i 'm just like age one to three , like we should be putting so much effort into that . and the other thing about totoro is it 's like , it 's like better for the environment because adult love totoro . it 's such good art that everyone love it . like i still have all my old totoro merch from when i wa a kid . like i literally have the most ragged old totoro merch . like everybody love it , everybody keep it . it 's like , why doe the art we have for baby need to suck and be not accessible to adult and then just be thrown out when , you know , they age out of it ? like , it 's like , i do n't know . i do n't have like a fully formed thought here , but this is just something i 've been thinking about a lot is like , how do we like , how do we have more totoroesque content ? like how do we have more content like this that like is universal and everybody love , but is like really geared to an emerging consciousness ? emerging consciousness in the first like three year of life that so much turmoil , so much evolution of mind is happening . it seems like a crucial time . would you say to make it not suck , do you think of basically treating a child like they have the capacity to have the brilliance of an adult or even beyond that ? is that how you think of that mind or ? no , cause they still , they like it when you talk weird and stuff . like they respond better to , cause even they can imitate better when your voice is higher . like people say like , oh , do n't do baby talk . but it 's like , when your voice is higher , it 's closer to something they can imitate . so they like , like the baby talk actually kind of work . like it help them learn to communicate . i 've found it to be more effective with learning word and stuff . but like , you 're not speaking down to them . like do they have the capacity\",\n          \"the following is a conversation with sean carroll . he 's a theoretical physicist at caltech specializing in quantum mechanic , gravity , and cosmology . he 's the author of several popular book , one on the arrow of time called from eternity to here , one on the higgs boson called particle at the end of the universe , and one on science and philosophy called the big picture on the origin of life , meaning , and the universe itself . he ha an upcoming book on quantum mechanic that you can preorder now called something deeply hidden . he writes one of my favorite blog on his website , preposterousuniverse.com . i recommend clicking on the greatest hit link that list accessible , interesting post on the arrow of time , dark matter , dark energy , the big bang , general relativity , string theory , quantum mechanic , and the big meta question about the philosophy of science , god , ethic , politics , academia , and much , much more . finally , and perhaps most famously , he 's the host of a podcast called mindscape that you should subscribe to and support on patreon . along with the joe rogan experience , sam harris 's making sense , and dan carlin 's hardcore history , sean 's mindscape podcast is one of my favorite way to learn new idea or explore different perspective and idea that i thought i understood . it wa truly an honor to meet and spend a couple hour with sean . it 's a bit heartbreaking to say that for the first time ever , the audio recorder for this podcast died in the middle of our conversation . there 's technical reason for this , having to do with phantom power that i now understand and will avoid . it took me one hour to notice and fix the problem . so , much like the universe is 68 % dark energy , roughly the same amount from this conversation wa lost , except in the memory of the two people involved and in my note . i 'm sure we 'll talk again and continue this conversation on this podcast or on sean 's . and of course , i look forward to it . this is the artificial intelligence podcast . if you enjoy it , subscribe on youtube , itunes , support it on patreon , or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman . and now , here 's my conversation with sean carroll . what do you think is more interesting and impactful , understanding how the universe work at a fundamental level or understanding how the human mind work ? you know , of course this is a crazy , meaningless , unanswerable question in some sense , because they 're both very interesting and there 's no absolute scale of interestingness that we can rate them on . there 's a glib answer that say the human brain is part of the universe , right ? and therefore , understanding the universe is more fundamental than understanding the human brain . but do you really believe that once we understand the fundamental way the universe work at the particle level , the force , we would be able to understand how the mind work ? no , certainly not . we can not understand how ice cream work just from understanding how particle work , right ? so i 'm a big believer in emergence . i 'm a big believer that there are different way of talking about the world beyond just the most fundamental microscopic one . you know , when we talk about table and chair and planet and people , we 're not talking the language of particle physic and cosmology . so , but understanding the universe , you did n't say just at the most fundamental level , right ? so understanding the universe at all level is part of that . i do think , you know , to be a little bit more fair to the question , there probably are general principle of complexity , biology , information processing , memory , knowledge , creativity that go beyond just the human brain , right ? and maybe one could count understanding those a part of understanding the universe . the human brain , a far a we know , is the most complex thing in the universe . so there 's , it 's certainly absurd to think that by understanding the fundamental law of particle physic , you get any direct insight on how the brain work . but then there 's this step from the fundamental of particle physic to information processing , which a lot of physicist and philosopher may be a little bit carelessly take when they talk about artificial intelligence . do you think of the universe a a kind of a computational device ? no , to be like , the honest answer there is no . there 's a sense in which the universe process information , clearly . there 's a sense in which the universe is like a computer , clearly . but in some sense , i think , i tried to say this once on my blog and no one agreed with me , but the universe is more like a computation than a computer because the universe happens once . a computer is a general purpose machine , right ? that you can ask it different question , even a pocket calculator , right ? and it 's set up to answer certain kind of question . the universe is n't that . so information processing happens in the universe , but it 's not what the universe is . and i know your mit colleague , seth lloyd , feel very differently about this , right ? well , you 're thinking of the universe a a closed system . i am . so what make a computer more like a pc , like a computing machine is that there 's a human that every once come up to it and move the mouse around . so input . give it input . give it input . and that 's why you 're saying it 's just a computation , a deterministic thing that 's just unrolling . but the immense complexity of it is nevertheless like processing . there 's a state and then it change with good rule . and there 's a sense for a lot of people that if the brain operates , the human brain operates within that world , then it 's simply just a small subset of that . and so there 's no reason we ca n't build arbitrarily great intelligence . yeah . do you think of intelligence in this way ? intelligence is tricky . i do n't have a definition of it offhand . so i remember this panel discussion that i saw on youtube . i wa n't there , but seth lloyd wa on the panel . and so wa martin rees , the famous astrophysicist . and seth gave his shtick for why the universe is a computer and explained this . and martin rees said , so what is not a computer ? and seth wa like , oh , that 's a good question . i 'm not sure . because if you have a sufficiently broad definition of what a computer is , then everything is , right ? and the simile or the analogy gain force when it excludes some thing . you know , is the moon going around the earth performing a computation ? i can come up with definition in which the answer is yes , but it 's not a very useful computation . i think that it 's absolutely helpful to think about the universe in certain situation , certain context , a an information processing device . i 'm even guilty of writing a paper called quantum circuit cosmology , where we modeled the whole universe a a quantum circuit . a a circuit . a a circuit , yeah . with qubits kind of thing ? with qubits basically , right , yeah . so , and qubits becoming more and more entangled . so do we wan na digress a little bit ? let 's do it . it 's kind of fun . so here 's a mystery about the universe that is so deep and profound that nobody talk about it . space expands , right ? and we talk about , in a certain region of space , a certain number of degree of freedom , a certain number of way that the quantum field and the particle in that region can arrange themselves . that number of degree of freedom in a region of space is arguably finite . we actually do n't know how many there are , but there 's a very good argument that say it 's a finite number . so a the universe expands and space get bigger , are there more degree of freedom ? if it 's an infinite number , it doe n't really matter . infinity time two is still infinity . but if it 's a finite number , then there 's more space , so there 's more degree of freedom . so where did they come from ? that would mean the universe is not a closed system . there 's more degree of freedom popping into existence . so what we suggested wa that there are more degree of freedom , and it 's not that they 're not there to start , but they 're not entangled to start . so the universe that you and i know of , the three dimension around u that we see , we said those are the entangled degree of freedom making up space time . and a the universe expands , there are a whole bunch of qubits in their zero state that become entangled with the rest of space time through the action of these quantum circuit . so what doe it mean that there 's now more degree of freedom a they become more entangled ? yeah , so . a the universe expands . that 's right , so there 's more and more degree of freedom that are entangled , that are playing part , playing the role of part of the entangled space time structure . so the basic , the underlying philosophy is that space time itself arises from the entanglement of some fundamental quantum degree of freedom . wow , okay , so at which point is most of the entanglement happening ? are we talking about close to the big bang ? are we talking about throughout the time of the life ? throughout history , yeah . so the idea is that at the big bang , almost all the degree of freedom that the universe could have were there , but they were unentangled with anything else . and that 's a reflection of the fact that the big bang had a low entropy . it wa a very simple , very small place . and a space expands , more and more degree of freedom become entangled with the rest of the world . well , i have to ask john carroll , what do you think of the thought experiment from nick bostrom that we 're living in a simulation ? so i think , let me contextualize that a little bit more . i think people do n't actually take this thought experiment . i think it 's quite interesting . it 's not very useful , but it 's quite interesting . from the perspective of ai , a lot of the learning that can be done usually happens in simulation from artificial example . and so it 's a constructive question to ask , how difficult is our real world to simulate ? right . which is kind of a dual part of , if we 're living in a simulation and somebody built that simulation , if you were to try to do it yourself , how hard would it be ? so obviously we could be living in a simulation . if you just want the physical possibility , then i completely agree that it 's physically possible . i do n't think that we actually are . so take this one piece of data into consideration . you know , we live in a big universe , okay ? there 's two trillion galaxy in our observable universe with 200 billion star in each galaxy , et cetera . it would seem to be a waste of resource to have a universe that big going on just to do a simulation . so in other word , i want to be a good bayesian . i want to ask under this hypothesis , what do i expect to see ? so the first thing i would say is i would n't expect to see a universe that wa that big , okay ? the second thing is i would n't expect the resolution of the universe to be a good a it is . so it 's always possible that if our superhuman simulator only have finite resource , that they do n't render the entire universe , right ? that the part that is out there , the two trillion galaxy , is n't actually being simulated fully , okay ? but then the obvious extrapolation of that is that only i am being simulated fully . like the rest of you are just non player character , right ? i 'm the only thing that is real . the rest of you are just chat bot . beyond this wall , i see the wall , but there is literally nothing on the other side of the wall . that is sort of the bayesian prediction . that 's what it would be like to do an efficient simulation of me . so like none of that seems quite realistic . i do n't see , i hear the argument that it 's just possible and easy to simulate lot of thing . i do n't see any evidence from what we know about our universe that we look like a simulated universe . now , maybe you can say , well , we do n't know what it would look like , but that 's just abandoning your bayesian responsibility . like your job is to say under this theory , here 's what you would expect to see . yeah , so certainly if you think about simulation a a thing that 's like a video game where only a small subset is being rendered . but say the entire , all the law of physic , the entire closed system of the quote unquote universe , it had a creator . yeah , it 's always possible . right , so that 's not useful to think about when you 're thinking about physic . the way nick bostrom phrase it , if it 's possible to simulate a universe , eventually we 'll do it . right . you can use that by the way for a lot of thing . well , yeah . but i guess the question is , how hard is it to create a universe ? i wrote a little blog post about this and maybe i 'm missing something , but there 's an argument that say not only that it might be possible to simulate a universe , but probably if you imagine that you actually attribute consciousness and agency to the little thing that we 're simulating , to our little artificial being , there 's probably a lot more of them than there are ordinary organic being in the universe or there will be in the future , right ? so there 's an argument that not only is being a simulation possible , it 's probable because in the space of all living consciousness , most of them are being simulated , right ? most of them are not at the top level . i think that argument must be wrong because it follows from that argument that , if we 're simulated , but we can also simulate other thing , well , but if we can simulate other thing , they can simulate other thing , right ? if we give them enough power and resolution and ultimately we 'll reach a bottom because the law of physic in our universe have a bottom , we 're made of atom and so forth , so there will be the cheapest possible simulation . and if you believe the original argument , you should conclude that we should be in the cheapest possible simulation because that 's where most people are . but we do n't look like that . it doe n't look at all like we 're at the edge of resolution , that we 're 16 bit thing . it seems much easier to make much lower level thing than we are . and also , i questioned the whole approach to the anthropic principle that say we are typical observer in the universe . i think that that 's not actually , i think that there 's a lot of selection that we can do that we 're typical within thing we already know , but not typical within all of the universe . so do you think there 's intelligent life , however you would like to define intelligent life , out there in the universe ? my guess is that there is not intelligent life in the observable universe other than u , simply on the basis of the fact that the likely number of other intelligent specie in the observable universe , there 's two likely number , zero or billion . and if there had been billion , you would have noticed already . for there to be literally like a small number , like , you know , star trek , there 's a dozen intelligent civilization in our galaxy , but not a billion , that 's weird . that 's sort of bizarre to me . it 's easy for me to imagine that there are zero others because there 's just a big bottleneck to making multicellular life or technological life or whatever . it 's very hard for me to imagine that there 's a whole bunch out there that have somehow remained hidden from u . the question i 'd like to ask is what would intelligent life look like ? what i mean by that question and where it 's going is what if intelligent life is just in some very big way different than the one that ha on earth ? that there 's all kind of intelligent life that operates at different scale of both size and temporal . right , that 's a great possibility because i think we should be humble about what intelligence is , what life is . we do n't even agree on what life is , much le what intelligent life is , right ? so that 's an argument for humility , saying there could be intelligent life of a very different character , right ? like you could imagine the dolphin are intelligent but never invent space travel because they live in the ocean and they do n't have thumb , right ? so they never invent technology , they never invent smelting . maybe the universe is full of intelligent specie that just do n't make technology , right ? that 's compatible with the data , i think . and i think maybe what you 're pointing at is even more out there version of intelligence , intelligence in intermolecular cloud or on the surface of a neutron star or in between the galaxy in giant thing where the equivalent of a heartbeat is 100 million year . on the one hand , yes , we should be very open minded about those thing . on the other hand , all of u share the same law of physic . there might be something about the law of physic , even though we do n't currently know exactly what that thing would be , that make meter and year the right length and timescales for intelligent life . maybe not , but we 're made of atom , atom have a certain size , we orbit star or star have a certain lifetime . it 's not impossible to me that there 's a sweet spot for intelligent life that we find ourselves in . so i 'm open minded either way , i 'm open minded either being humble and there 's all sort of different kind of life or no , there 's a reason we just do n't know it yet why life like ours is the kind of life that 's out there . yeah , i 'm of two mind too , but i often wonder if our brain is just designed to quite obviously to operate and see the world in these timescales and we 're almost blind and the tool we 've created for detecting thing are blind to the kind of observation needed to see intelligent life at other scale . well , i 'm totally open to that , but so here 's another argument i would make , we have looked for intelligent life , but we 've looked at for it in the dumbest way we can , by turning radio telescope to the sky . and why in the world would a super advanced civilization randomly beam out radio signal wastefully in all direction into the universe ? that just doe n't make any sense , especially because in order to think that you would actually contact another civilization , you would have to do it forever , you have to keep doing it for million of year , that sound like a waste of resource . if you thought that there were other solar system with planet around them , where maybe intelligent life did n't yet exist , but might someday , you would n't try to talk to it with radio wave , you would send a spacecraft out there and you would park it around there and it would be like , from our point of view , it 'd be like 2001 , where there wa a monolith . monolith . there could be an artifact , in fact , the other way work also , right ? there could be artifact in our solar system that have been put there by other technologically advanced civilization and that 's how we will eventually contact them . we just have n't explored the solar system well enough yet to find them . the reason why we do n't think about that is because we 're young and impatient , right ? like , it would take more than my lifetime to actually send something to another star system and wait for it and then come back . so , but if we start thinking on hundred of thousand of year or million year time scale , that 's clearly the right thing to do . are you excited by the thing that elon musk is doing with spacex in general ? space , but the idea of space exploration , even though your , or your specie is young and impatient ? yeah . no , i do think that space travel is crucially important , long term . even to other star system . and i think that many people overestimate the difficulty because they say , look , if you travel 1 % the speed of light to another star system , we 'll be dead before we get there , right ? and i think that it 's much easier . and therefore , when they write their science fiction story , they imagine we 'd go faster than the speed of light because otherwise they 're too impatient , right ? we 're not gon na go faster than the speed of light , but we could easily imagine that the human lifespan get extended to thousand of year . and once you do that , then the star are much closer effectively , right ? and then what 's a hundred year trip , right ? so i think that that 's gon na be the future , the far future , not my lifetime once again , but baby step . unless your lifetime get extended . well , it 's in a race against time , right ? a friend of mine who actually think about these thing said , you know , you and i are gon na die , but i do n't know about our grandchild . that 's , i do n't know , predicting the future is hard , but that 's at least a plausible scenario . and so , yeah , no , i think that a we discussed earlier , there are threat to the earth , known and unknown , right ? having spread humanity and biology elsewhere is a really important longterm goal . what kind of question can science not currently answer , but might soon ? when you think about the problem and the mystery before u that may be within reach of science . i think an obvious one is the origin of life . we do n't know how that happened . there 's a difficulty in knowing how it happened historically actually , you know , literally on earth , but starting life from non life is something i kind of think we 're close to , right ? we 're really . you really think so ? like how difficult is it to start life ? well , i 've talked to people , including on the podcast about this . you know , life requires three thing . life a we know it . so there 's a difference with life , which who know what it is , and life a we know it , which we can talk about with some intelligence . so life a we know it requires compartmentalization . you need like a little membrane around your cell . metabolism , you need to take in food and eat it and let that make you do thing . and then replication , okay ? so you need to have some information about who you are that you pas down to future generation . in the lab , compartmentalization seems pretty easy . not hard to make lipid bilayers that come into little cellular wall pretty easily . metabolism and replication are hard , but replication we 're close to . people have made rna like molecule in the lab that i think the state of the art is , they 're not able to make one molecule that reproduces itself , but they 're able to make two molecule that reproduce each other . so that 's okay . that 's pretty close . metabolism is harder , believe it or not , even though it 's sort of the most obvious thing , but you want some sort of controlled metabolism and the actual cellular machinery in our body is quite complicated . it 's hard to see it just popping into existence all by itself . it probably took a while , but we 're making progress . and in fact , i do n't think we 're spending nearly enough money on it . if i were the nsf , i would flood this area with money because it would change our view of the world if we could actually make life in the lab and understand how it wa made originally here on earth . and i 'm sure it 'd have some ripple effect that help cure disease and so on . i mean , just that understanding . so synthetic biology is a wonderful big frontier where we 're making cell . right now , the best way to do that is to borrow heavily from existing biology , right ? well , craig venter several year ago created an artificial cell , but all he did wa , not all he did , it wa a tremendous accomplishment , but all he did wa take out the dna from a cell and put in entirely new dna and let it boot up and go . what about the leap to creating intelligent life on earth ? yeah . again , we define intelligence , of course , but let 's just even say homo sapiens , the modern intelligence in our human brain . do you have a sense of what 's involved in that leap and how big of a leap that is ? so ai would count in this , or do you really want life ? do you want really an organism in some sense ? ai would count , i think . okay . yeah , of course , of course ai would count . well , let 's say artificial consciousness , right ? so i do not think we are on the threshold of creating artificial consciousness . i think it 's possible . i 'm not , again , very educated about how close we are , but my impression is not that we 're really close because we understand how little we understand of consciousness and what it is . so if we do n't have any idea what it is , it 's hard to imagine we 're on the threshold of making it ourselves . but it 's doable , it 's possible . i do n't see any obstacle in principle . so yeah , i would hold out some interest in that happening eventually . i think in general , consciousness , i think we would be just surprised how easy consciousness is once we create intelligence . i think consciousness is a thing that 's just something we all fake . well , good . no , actually , i like this idea that in fact , consciousness is way le mysterious than we think because we 're all at every time , at every moment , le conscious than we think we are , right ? we can fool thing . and i think that plus the idea that you not only have artificial intelligent system , but you put them in a body , right , give them a robot body , that will help the faking a lot . yeah , i think creating consciousness in artificial consciousness is a simple a asking a roomba to say , i 'm conscious , and refusing to be talked out of it . could be , it could be . and i mean , i 'm almost being silly , but that 's what we do . that 's what we do with each other . this is the kind of , that consciousness is also a social construct . and a lot of our idea of intelligence is a social construct . and so reaching that bar involves something that 's beyond , that doe n't necessarily involve the fundamental understanding of how you go from electron to neuron to cognition . no , actually , i think that is an extremely good point . and in fact , what it suggests is , so yeah , you referred to kate darling , who i had on the podcast , and who doe these experiment with very simple robot , but they look like animal , and they can look like they 're experiencing pain , and we human being react very negatively to these little robot looking like they 're experiencing pain . and what you wan na say is , yeah , but they 're just robot . it 's not really pain , right ? it 's just some electron going around . but then you realize , you and i are just electron going around , and that 's what pain is also . and so what i would have an easy time imagining is that there is a spectrum between these simple little robot that kate work with and a human being , where there are thing that sort of by some strict definition , turing test level thing are not conscious , but nevertheless walk and talk like they 're conscious . and it could be that the future is , i mean , siri is close , right ? and so it might be the future ha a lot more agent like that . and in fact , rather than someday going , aha , we have consciousness , we 'll just creep up on it with more and more accurate reflection of what we expect . and in the future , maybe the present , for example , we have n't met before , and you 're basically assuming that i 'm human a it 's a high probability at this time because the yeah , but in the future , there might be question mark around that , right ? yeah , no , absolutely . certainly video are almost to the point where you should n't trust them already . photo you ca n't trust , right ? video is easier to trust , but we 're getting worse that , we 're getting better at faking them , right ? yeah , so physical embodied people , what 's so hard about faking that ? so this is very depressing , this conversation we 're having right now . so i mean , to me , it 's exciting . to me , you 're doing it . so it 's exciting to you , but it 's a sobering thought . we 're very bad , right ? at imagining what the next 50 year are gon na be like when we 're in the middle of a phase transition a we are right now . yeah , and i , in general , i 'm not blind to all the threat . i am excited by the power of technology to solve , to protect u against the threat a they evolve . i 'm not a much a steven pinker optimistic about the world , but in everything i 've seen , all of the brilliant people in the world that i 've met are good people . so the army of the good in term of the development of technology is large . okay , you 're way more optimistic than i am . i think that goodness and badness are equally distributed among intelligent and unintelligent people . i do n't see much of a correlation there . interesting . neither of u have proof . yeah , exactly . again , opinion are free , right ? nor definition of good and evil . we come without definition or without data opinion . so what kind of question can science not currently answer and may never be able to answer in your view ? well , the obvious one is what is good and bad ? what is right and wrong ? i think that there are question that , science tell u what happens , what the world is and what it doe . it doe n't say what the world should do or what we should do , because we 're part of the world . but we are part of the world and we have the ability to feel like something 's right , something 's wrong . and to make a very long story very short , i think that the idea of moral philosophy is systematizing our intuition of what is right and what is wrong . and science might be able to predict ahead of time what we will do , but it wo n't ever be able to judge whether we should have done it or not . so , you 're kind of unique in term of scientist . listen , it doe n't have to do with podcasts , but even just reaching out , i think you referred to a sort of doing interdisciplinary science . so you reach out and talk to people that are outside of your discipline , which i always hope that 's what science wa for . in fact , i wa a little disillusioned when i realized that academia is very siloed . yeah . and so the question is , how , at your own level , how do you prepare for these conversation ? how do you think about these conversation ? how do you open your mind enough to have these conversation ? and it may be a little bit broader , how can you advise other scientist to have these kind of conversation ? not at the podcast , the fact that you 're doing a podcast is awesome , other people get to hear them , but it 's also good to have it without mics in general . it 's a good question , but a tough one to answer . i think about a guy i know who 's a personal trainer , and he wa asked on a podcast , how do we psych ourselves up to do a workout ? how do we make that discipline to go and work out ? and he 's like , why are you asking me ? i ca n't stop working out . i do n't need to psych myself up . so , and likewise , he asked me , how do you get to have interdisciplinary conversation on all sort of different thing , all sort of different people ? i 'm like , that 's what make me go , right ? like that 's , i could n't stop doing that . i did that long before any of them were recorded . in fact , a lot of the motivation for starting recording it wa making sure i would read all these book that i had purchased , right ? like all these book i wanted to read , not enough time to read them . and now if i have the motivation , cause i 'm gon na interview pat churchland , i 'm gon na finally read her book . you know , and it 's absolutely true that academia is extraordinarily siloed , right ? we do n't talk to people . we rarely do . and in fact , when we do , it 's punished . you know , like the people who do it successfully generally first became very successful within their little siloed discipline . and only then did they start expanding out . if you 're a young person , you know , i have graduate student . i try to be very , very candid with them about this , that it 's , you know , most graduate student are to not become faculty member , right ? it 's a tough road . and so live the life you wan na live , but do it with your eye open about what it doe to your job chance . and the more broad you are and the le time you spend hyper specializing in your field , the lower your job chance are . that 's just an academic reality . it 's terrible , i do n't like it , but it 's a reality . and for some people , that 's fine . like there 's plenty of people who are wonderful scientist who have zero interest in branching out and talking to thing , to anyone outside their field . but it is disillusioning to me . some of the , you know , romantic notion i had of the intellectual academic life is belied by the reality of it . the idea that we should reach out beyond our discipline and that is a positive good is just so rare in university that it may a well not exist at all . but that said , even though you 're saying you 're doing it like the personal trainer , because you just ca n't help it , you 're also an inspiration to others . like i could speak for myself . you know , i also have a career i 'm thinking about , right ? and without your podcast , i may have not have been doing this at all , right ? so it make me realize that these kind of conversation is kind of what science is about in many way . the reason we write paper , this exchange of idea , is it 's much harder to do interdisciplinary paper , i would say . and conversation are easier . so conversation is the beginning . and in the field of ai , it 's obvious that we should think outside of pure computer vision competition on a particular data set . we should think about the broader impact of how this can be , you know , reaching out to physic , to psychology , to neuroscience and having these conversation so that you 're an inspiration . and so never know how the world change . i mean , the fact that this stuff is out there and i 've a huge number of people come up to me , grad student , really loving the podcast , inspired by it . and they will probably have that , they 'll be ripple effect when they become faculty and so on and so on . we can end on a balance between pessimism and optimism . and sean , thank you so much for talking to me , it wa awesome . no , lex , thank you very much for this conversation . it wa great .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
